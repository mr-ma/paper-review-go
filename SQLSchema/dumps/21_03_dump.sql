To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI\'s, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security. Finally, this paper briefly describes future research directions to secure these critical CPSs and help the research community in identifying the research gaps in this regard.','IEEE Access',1,'A.

Changes can occur on almost every level, e.g. change in demand of customers, change of law, or change of the corporate strategy. Not adapting to these changes can result in financial and legal consequences for any business organisation. IT-controlled business processes are essential parts of modern organisations which motivates why business processes are required to efficiently adapt to these changes in a quick and flexible way. This requirement suggests a more dynamic handling of business processes and their models, moving from design-time business process models to run-time business process models. One general approach to address this problem is provided by the community of models@run.time , in which models reflect the system’s current state at any point in time and allow immediate reasoning and adaptation mechanisms. This paper examines the potential role of business process models at run-time by: (1) discussing the state-of the art of both, business process modelling and models@run.time, (2) reflecting on the nature of business processes at run-time, and (3) most importantly, highlighting key research challenges that need addressing to make this step.','',2,'David RedlichGordon BlairAwais RashidThomas MolkaWasif Gilani','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(5,'Integration Adapter Modeling','2015','0',' Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Conceptual modeling Language design Message endpoints Quality of service','Abstract Integration Adapters are a fundamental part of an integration system, since they provide (business) applications access to its messaging channel.

In previous work, the integration control and data flow syntax and semantics have been expressed in the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) as a semantic model for message-based integration, while adapter and the related quality of service modeling were left for further studies. In this work we specify common adapter capabilities and derive general modeling patterns, for which we define a compliant representation in BPMN. The patterns extend previous work by the adapter flow, evaluated syntactically and semantically for common adapter characteristics.','',2,'Daniel RitterManuel Holzleitner','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(6,'Geospatial Information Security Web Service Based on Agent','2010','0','WebService;geospatial information security;mobile agent','With the development of remote sensing technology, the use of remote sensing images collected by space platforms is becoming more and more pervasive.

It groups disparate data in ways that enable users to do new things or accomplish common tasks with newfound efficiency. The introduction of mashup applications and their increasing use by users in the field of e-Learning and e-commerce highlights new issues in a context called the “smart city”. Indeed, transportation based on private cars, public transportation services and shared bicycles need appropriate user interfaces, which can be “mashuped” to allow an integrated approach to transportation related to weather conditions, real-time traffic situations and personal preferences. These new needs for composition and combination (orchestration) of existing web services and their underlying user interfaces are good examples of mashuping. First, we provide in this paper some valuable explanations on two kinds of orchestration: service orchestration and HCI (Human Computer Interface) orchestration. Secondly, we apply this global approach to the context of “smart cities”.','',2,'Abdelghani AtroucheDjilali IdoughiBertrand David','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(8,'An authentication and access control framework for CoAP-based Internet of Things','2014','0','','Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) are two very hot research topics today, and more and more products are starting to appear on the market. Research has shown that the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can enable distributed application and devices to device communication, even on very resource constrained devices, and thus play an important role for IoT and CPS. In order to realize the vision of Internet of Things, communication between devices must be secured. Security mechanisms for resource constrained devices has attracted much interest from the academic community, where research groups have shown solutions like IPsec, VPN-tunnels, (D)TLS, etc. are feasible to use on this type of networks. However, even though the use of well-known security mechanisms are vital for SOA-based IoT/CPS networks and systems to be protected, they do not provide any fine-grain access control. In this paper, a CoAP-based framework for service-level access control on low-power devices is presented. The framework allows fine grain access control on a per service and method basis. For example, by using this approach a device can allow read/write access to its services to one group of users while only allowing read access to another group. Users without the right credentials are not even allowed to discover available services. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, several implementations are presented together with test results. The aim is to provide a holistic framework for secure SOA-based low power networks comprise by resource constrain devices.','IECON 2014 - 40th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society',1,'P.

Given the black-box nature of services, selecting a trustworthy service that best fits users\' requirements is critical. Once a set of services fulfilling users\' functional requirements has been found, which one a user chooses depends mostly on the Quality of Services (QoS), particularly security, trust and reputation. This paper proposes a trust management model to support service discovery and selection based on QoS. We define a quantitative trust-evaluation method for dynamic service discovery and selection and show experimental results. The proposed model allows service consumers to get the most trustworthy services possible. Our mechanism uses consumers\' feedback to describe how trustworthy they have found services and service providers to be. Choosing services using a quantitative measurement rather than their intuition will allow consumers to select a highly reliable service that meets their quality and technical requirements.

In particular, in the CancerGrid project, we have been developing model-driven techniques for the generation of software tools to support clinical trials. A domain metamodel captures the community’s best practice in trial design. A scientist authors a trial protocol, modelling their trial by instantiating the metamodel; customized software artifacts to support trial execution are generated automatically from the scientist’s model. The metamodel is expressed as an XML Schema, in such a way that it can be instantiated by completing a form to generate a conformant XML document. The same process works at a second level for trial execution: among the artifacts generated from the protocol are models of the data to be collected, and the clinician conducting the trial instantiates such models in reporting observations—again by completing a form to create a conformant XML document, representing the data gathered during that observation. Simple standard form management tools are all that is needed. Our approach is applicable to a wide variety of information-modelling domains: not just clinical trials, but also electronic public sector computing, customer relationship management, document workflow, and so on.','',2,'Jim DaviesJeremy GibbonsRadu CalinescuCharles CrichtonSteve HarrisAndrew Tsui','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(11,'A virtual mart for knowledge discovery in databases','2013','4','','Abstract The Web has profoundly reshaped our vision of information management and processing, enlightening the power of a collaborative model of information production and consumption.

To this end we utilise a security enhanced BPMN notation to define access control properties. To enhance the usability the complex and technical details are hidden from the process modeller by using an automatic translation of the process model into a process meta language (Promela) based on Coloured Petri net (CPN) semantics. The model checker SPIN is used for the process model verification and a trace file is written to provide visual feedback to the modeller on the abstraction level of the verified process model.

When applying our integrated methodology we recognized that models for the same business case are similar, but still varying for different business partner networks. Accordingly, a systematic approach to derive a model from another model, i.e., from a reference model, is needed. Significant achievements have been made by the reference modeling community in finding ways to leverage the potentials of model reuse in business process modeling.

The key point guiding the underlying design is that, once gathered, requirements need to be processed by decomposition towards the generation of a specified systems design. A representational framework allows for the expression of high level abstract conceptions under a single schema, which may then be made explicit in terms of axiomatic relations and expressed in a suitable ontology. The initial experimental results indicate that our framework for filtered selection of a suitable ontology operates in a computationally efficient manner.','Information Systems Frontiers',1,'R. B. K.

Therefore, transactional properties and non-functional quality of service (QoS) properties are crucial for selecting the web services to take part in the composition. Transactional properties ensure reliability of composite Web service, and QoS properties can identify the best candidate web services from a set of functionally-equivalent services. In this paper we define a Colored Petri Net (CPN) model which involves transactional properties of Web services in the composition process.

However, users find it complex in interacting with such environments due to the presence of numerous devices and services. In this situation, providing context-aware implicit or automatic interaction support may help reducing the cognitive load of the users and facilitate easy access of the available devices and services. However, due to the imprecision in context information, implicit interactions performed by the environment often leads to mis-automation. The result of such impaired implicitness causes distrust and dissatisfaction to the user. In order to address this issue, we propose a system that considers quality of information to dynamically adjust the level of implicit interaction and allows a system to operate in different modes such as full-automation, action suggestion, simple notification, or null action. We conduct experiment in a smart home scenario in order to elicit users’ acceptance and trust regarding the proposed system. Our experiment shows that dynamic and alternative mode of interaction not only increases the satisfaction of users but also helps to avoid distrust in automated actions carried out by the environment under varying contexts.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',1,'M.

The service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm is a popular option for the integration of software services and execution of distributed business processes. Entailment constraints, such as mutual exclusion and binding constraints, are important means to control process execution. Mutually exclusive tasks result from the division of powerful rights and responsibilities to prevent fraud and abuse. In contrast, binding constraints define that a subject who performed one task must also perform the corresponding bound task(s). Objective We aim to provide a model-driven approach for the specification and enforcement of task-based entailment constraints in distributed service-based business processes. Method Based on a generic metamodel, we define a domain-specific language (DSL) that maps the different modeling-level artifacts to the implementation-level. The DSL integrates elements from role-based access control (RBAC) with the tasks that are performed in a business process. Process definitions are annotated using the DSL, and our software platform uses automated model transformations to produce executable WS-BPEL specifications which enforce the entailment constraints. We evaluate the impact of constraint enforcement on runtime performance for five selected service-based processes from existing literature. Results Our evaluation demonstrates that the approach correctly enforces task-based entailment constraints at runtime. The performance experiments illustrate that the runtime enforcement operates with an overhead that scales well up to the order of several ten thousand logged invocations. Using our DSL annotations, the user-defined process definition remains declarative and clean of security enforcement code. Conclusion Our approach decouples the concerns of (non-technical) domain experts from technical details of entailment constraint enforcement. The developed framework integrates seamlessly with WS-BPEL and the Web services technology stack. Our prototype implementation shows the feasibility of the approach, and the evaluation points to future work and further performance optimizations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Key PHEP activities involved in supporting this cycle include planning; surveillance; alerting; resource assessment and management; data-driven decision support; and intervention for prevention and control of disease or injury in populations. Information systems supporting these activities are most effective in assuring optimal response to an emergent health event when they are integrated within an informatics framework that supports routine (day to day) information exchange within the health information exchange community. In late April 2009, New York State (NYS) initiated a statewide PHEP response to the emergence of Novel Influenza A (H1N1), culminating in a statewide vaccination campaign during the last quarter of 2009. The established informatics framework of integrated information systems within NYS conveyed significant advantages and flexibility in supporting the range of PHEP activities required for an effective response to this health event. This chapter describes, and provides, performance metrics to illustrate how a public health informatics framework can enhance the efficacy of all phases of a public health emergency response. It also provides informatics lessons learned from the event.','Information Systems and e-Business Management',1,'Ivan J. GothamLinh H. LeDebra L. SottolanoKathryn J.

Therefore, the Web service composition has unfolded broadly in the research side. However, the current attempts to classify Web service composition is not appropriate to the objectives. This paper proposes a novel classification matrix for Web service composition, that distinguishes between the context and technology dimension. The context dimension is aimed at analyzing the QoS influence on the effort of Web service composition, while the technology dimension focuses on the technique influence on the effort.

As the new generation of industrial devices coming to the shop floors features greatly improved storage, computing and networking capabilities, the factory of the future transforms itself to a system of systems, where of large numbers of heterogeneous networked embedded devices dynamically exchange information, complement each other’s functionality and provide new innovative capabilities that satisfy the emergent dynamic business requirements. This new breed of networked embedded devices goes beyond simple passive roles, e.g. being able to store and report information about themselves and their physical surroundings once queried, but execute complex computations and global logic locally, as well as dynamically adapt to fulfil goal-driven conditions. They communicate in an open interoperable way, form cooperative peer-to-peer networks and strongly interact with enterprise systems. This leads to highly modular, manageable and dynamic factories that will be able to adapt and optimize their behaviour to achieve the business goals pursued in a cross-layer collaborative way.','The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology',1,'Stamatis Karnouskos','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(53,'A Reference Software Architecture to Support Unmanned Aircraft Integration in the National Airspace System','2013','5',' Unmanned Air vehicle Sense and Avoid Service Oriented Architecture Testbed Reference architecture','Abstract This paper outlines an architecture that provides data and software services to enable a set of Unmanned Aircraft (UA) platforms to operate in a wide range of air domains which may include terminal, en route, oceanic and tactical.

Such interactions are based on predefined agreements and constraints that characterize the relationships between the actors and are modeled with the notion of social context . In complex and changing environments, such interaction relationships, and thus social contexts, are also subject to change. In existing approaches, the relationships among actors are not modeled explicitly, and instead are often hard-coded into the application. Furthermore, these approaches do not provide adequate adaptation support for such relationships as the changes occur in user requirements and environments. In our approach, inter-actor relationships in an application are modeled explicitly using social contexts, and their execution environment is generated and adaptations are managed by the SCaaS platform. The key features of our approach include externalization of the interaction relationships from the applications, representation and modeling of such relationships from a domain and actor perspectives, their implementation using a service oriented paradigm, and support for their runtime adaptation. We quantify the platform’s adaptation overhead and demonstrate its feasibility and applicability by developing a telematics application that supports cooperative convoy.','',1,'Muhammad Ashad KabirJun HanAlan ColmanJian Yu','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(57,'Methods towards API Usability: A Structural Analysis of Usability Problem Categories','2012','1',' API Usability Contextual Interaction Framework HCI','Abstract The usability of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is one of the main factors defining the success of a software based framework. Research in the area of human computer interaction (HCI) currently mainly focuses on end-user usability and only little research has been done regarding the usability of APIs. In this paper, we present a methodology on how to use and combine HCI methods with the goal to evaluate the usability of APIs. The methodology consist of three phases - a heuristic evaluation, a developer workshop and interviews. We setup a case-study according to the methodology, in which we are evaluating the usability of a service-oriented framework API. The goal was to explore different HCI methods and compare the applicability of such methods to find usability problems in an API. The case-study combined qualitative and quantitative methods in order to investigate the usability and intuitiveness of the API itself. It allowed us to identify relevant problem areas for usability related issues that could be mapped to specific types of HCI methods. Examples for this are e.g. structural problems, which are identified mainly in inspection methods, while problems regarding errors and exception handling are mainly identified during the hands-on example part of the developer workshops conducted. The resulting problem areas allow us to develop a first classification of API related usability problems that are making the relevancy of usability issues for APIs more explicit and applicable.','',1,'Thomas GrillOndrej PolacekManfred Tscheligi','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(58,'IMDD-based bidirectional 20 Gb/s/λ WDM-PON with Nyquist 4 PAM employing Rayleigh backscattering noise detection-based self wavelength management','2016','0',' WDM-PON Channel-reuse Nyquist 4 level pulse amplitude modulation Intensity modulation Direct detection Fiber Bragg grating filter Self wavelength management','Abstract We experimentally demonstrate an optical intensity modulation transmitter with a Nyquist 4 level pulse amplitude modulation and direct detection (DD) receiver-based channel-reuse wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-PON).

There are, however, quite a few challenges towards achieving seamless operation. Such challenges arise from heterogeneity in infrastructure and coordination mechanism at participant organizations, as well as time and cost associated with recovery from failure. Our research presents foundations for a reliable scheme for recovery from failure of workflow processes spanning through multiple business entities. First, a system model is adapted from the mobile computing literature that serves to establish the requirements to be enforced by each participating organization. In our model, we adopt the Maximal Sequence Path (MSP) approach from Yoo et al . (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 2132:222–236, 2001 ), as a means of decomposing workflows into mobile agent-driven processes that communicate via web services at each organization. This decomposition ensures defining logical points within the dynamics of a workflow instance for locating accurate and consistent states of the system for recovery in case of a failure. Then, a set of algorithms for various business scenarios are developed and presented as practical solutions. These algorithms are shown to create checkpoints such that the system is always in a globally consistent state. As such, these algorithms constitute a set of standards that can be incorporated in business process management suites that support reliable inter-organizational collaboration.','Information Systems Frontiers',1,'Haluk DemirkanSagnika SenMichael GoulJason Nichols','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(64,'Management of service compositionbased on self-controlled components','2015','1',' Service component Quality of service Autonomic control Service composition','Abstract Cloud computing and Future Internet promise a new ecosystem where everything is \"as a service\", reachable and connectable anywhere and anytime, everyone succeeding to get a service composition that meets his needs.

In this article we introduce an entity of service composition called Self-Controlled Component (SCC), including, since the design step, functional and non-functional specifications. SCCs benefit both from the strong structure, explicit composition, and autonomic management of component-oriented programming, from the highly dynamic composition, and from the discovery capacities of service-oriented computing. Self-control mechanisms are then attached automatically to SCCs to enable autonomic application management during execution. The objective of this new concept is to provide strong Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees of composed applications. We illustrate the approach using an example called Springoo, to how in the context of a legacy application the contributions and benefits of our solution.

The Decentralized Operation Procedure1 (DOP) technique allows interoperability definitions of system interactions to be created as XML files and deployed across the battlefield environment. By extending the security information definitions within the DOP technique, it is intended to provide sufficient incorporated information to allow boundary protection devices to also immediately load and utilize a DOP XML file and then apply established standards of security. This allows boundary devices to be updated with the same dynamism as the deployment of new DOPs and DOP interoperability definitions to also exploit coalitional capabilities having crossed security boundaries.

We focus on how resources can be allocated in a cost-effective way within this model, a problem which we refer to as the feature placement problem. A formal description of this problem, that can be used to allocate resources in a cost-effective way, is provided. We take both the cost of failure to place features, and the cost of using servers into account, making it possible to take energy costs or the cost of public cloud infrastructure into consideration during the placement calculation. Four algorithms that can be used to solve the feature placement problem are defined. We evaluate the algorithm solutions, comparing them with the optimal solution determined using an integer linear problem solver, and evaluating the execution times of the algorithms, making use of both generated inputs and a use case based on three applications.

Manually assigning feedback costs much time and suffers from several drawbacks. Only automatic trust calculation is feasible for large-scale service-oriented applications. Therefore an automatic method of trust calculation is proposed. To make the calculation accurate, the Kalman filter is adopted to filter out malicious non-trust quality criterion (NTQC) values instead of malicious trust values. To offer higher detection accuracy, it is further improved by considering the relationship between NTQC values and variances. Since dishonest or inaccurate values can still influence trust values, the similarity between consumers is used to weight data from other consumers. As existing models only used the Euclidean function and ignored others, a collection of distance functions is modified to calculate the similarity. Finally, experiments are carried out to access the robustness of the proposed model. The results show that the improved algorithm can offer higher detection accuracy, and it was discovered that another equation outperformed the Euclidean function.','IET Software',1,'B. Ye; M.

In general, many business systems developed based on web services are indeed heterogeneous software systems that process business data by complying with integrated business rules. Web services have until recently been regarded as software building blocks that can be assembled to construct the distributed business applications of the next generation and assist enterprises to promote operational efficiency and organizational flexibility. As a result, Web services can be employed to improve the integration of value chain processes and/or activities. However, Web services are usually implicit as a black box that prohibits users and developers from comprehending an actual scenario and present status inside the web service component as said developers deal with other associated heterogeneous components. Additionally, developers are unable to increase overall efficiency while integrating Web service components if they do not possess the ability to modify/improve the implementation scenario. This research first defines the component as corresponding state transitions that should be decomposed further into sub-transactions and semantic transactions, which can make possible re-implementation of the specific Web services in an efficient way and increase the overall throughputs for the new composite Web services. Secondly, this study implements an MTNet Project, which can be employed to assist developers’ analysis and construction of the semantic models for Web services according to the previously described definitions. Last, the simulation experiment provided in this manuscript proved that the proposed semantic model can indeed improve the throughput and, consequently, decrease the delay time for concurrent transactions.','Information Systems Frontiers',2,'Shing-Han LiShi-Ming HuangDavid C.

The ontology systems specify semantic information about devices, services, and workflows used in various smart home, and users can compose and recompose services for their specific needs. New devices, workflows, and services can be added into ontology. Most of the steps in this process can be automated including code generation. For example, service composition will be carried out in three steps: abstract workflow design, function construction, and device discovery, and different codes can be generated for different computing platforms such as Java and Open Services Gateway initiative environments. In this way, a variety of smart home can be constructed rapidly using the framework by discovery and composition using existing services and workflows.

Traditional structural management of resources has been unable to meet the needs of global resource sharing because of the lack of efficiency in expressing spatiotemporal features of CI. Since the CI resources leap over time and space, it is essential to establish a unified spatiotemporal metadata model for CI services across different disciplines. The adoption of a system with intuitive resource visualization and management would aid interoperability and collaboration of scientific research activities among organizations and domains. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal metadata model which characterizes the resources as spatial entities with time and space dimensions. Furthermore, a web-based GIS platform is implemented for spatiotemporal visualization. The well-known data, computing and network resources are used as the cases in the model and the visualization system. This allows the easy integration of emerging CI services into the system.

Such processes typically span interactions between people and services across globally distributed companies. Web services and SOA are the defacto technology to implement compositions of humans and services. The increasing complexity of compositions and the distribution of people and services require adaptive and context-aware interaction models. To support complex interaction scenarios, we introduce a mixed service-oriented system composed of both human-provided and Software-Based Services (SBSs) interacting to perform joint activities or to solve emerging problems. However, competencies of people evolve over time, thereby requiring approaches for the automated management of actor skills, reputation, and trust. Discovering the right actor in mixed service-oriented systems is challenging due to scale and temporary nature of collaborations. We present a novel approach addressing the need for flexible involvement of experts and knowledge workers in distributed collaborations. We argue that the automated inference of trust between members is a key factor for successful collaborations. Instead of following a security perspective on trust, we focus on dynamic trust in collaborative networks. We discuss Human-Provided Services (HPSs) and an approach for managing user preferences and network structures. HPS allows experts to offer their skills and capabilities as services that can be requested on demand.

This approach not only enables performance to be maintained at different levels for different tenants depending on their priorities, but also autonomously detects the overloads of aggressive tenants and dynamically changes the control objectives to safeguard the business operations of other tenants. The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of the nonlinear feedback control.

However, no ideal solutions have been worked out for these problems. As a result of our study, we have presented in this paper a policy-based architecture termed policy-based architecture for web services security processing (PBA4WSSP) to meet the dynamic, complete and fine-grained security requirements. In PBA4WSSP, the processing of all security problems is based on security policy in service stage to support flexibly security configuration. Moreover, we have designed a service policy model to describe the fine-grained security requirements. And the conversion method between security policy model and security policy expression has also been described. In addition, a staged complete security processing architecture is provided to reduce the dependency among protocol implementations. Furthermore, with PBA4WSSP, a web service security module has been designed and implemented as well.

However, in order to fulfill the security requirements, technical security controls or mechanisms have to be considered and deployed on the target system. Based on these security controls security patterns have to be selected. The MDS (Model Driven Security) approach uses security requirement models at a high level of abstraction to automatically generate security artefacts that configure security services. The main drawback of the current MDS solutions is that they consider just one security pattern for each security requirement. Current SOA and cloud services are scattered across multiple heterogeneous security domains. Partners and clients with different security infrastructures are changing continuously, which requires the support of multiple patterns for the same security service. The challenge is to provide configurable security services that can support different patterns. In order to overcome this shortcoming we propose a framework that integrates pattern refinement to the MDS approach. In this approach a security pattern refinement layer is added to the traditional MDS layers. The pattern refinement layer supports the configuration of one security service with different patterns, which are stored in a pattern catalog. For example, our approach enables the generation of security artefacts that configure a non-repudiation service to support both fair non-repudiation and naive non-repudiation patterns.','',2,'Basel KattMatthias GanderRuth BreuMichael Felderer','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(105,'A Metamodel for the Design of Access-Control Policy Enforcement Managers: Work in Progress','2012','0','','Abstract This paper presents a metamodel of a policy enforcement manager responsible for applying the rules defined in security policies with the aim to constraint the access to the functionalities and data of information systems.

The proposed approach aims at reducing the operation and maintenance cost of the system by using a messaging network enhanced with the capability to store, inspect and analyze selected portions of the exchanged messages under the strict control of security and privacy. Complexity makes any information system vulnerable to design flaws, operation error, and security problems.

A mitigation action is a sequence of controlled changes applied to the running process instance, taking into account a snapshot of the process resources and data, and the current status of the system in which the process is executed. These actions are proposed as recommendations to help process administrators mitigate process-related risks as soon as they arise.

Business process models play an important role in bridging the gap between the business domain and the information technology, increasing the weight of business modeling as first step of software development. However, the traditional way of representing a process is not suitable for the so-called Knowledge-Intensive Processes (KIP). This type of process comprises sequences of activities based on intensive acquisition, sharing, storage and (re)use of knowledge, so that the amount of value added to the organization depends on the actor knowledge. Current research in the literature points to the lack of approaches to make this kind of process explicit and strategies for handling information that is necessary for their understanding and support. The goal of this paper is to present KIPO—a knowledge-intensive process ontology, which encompasses a clear and semantically rich definition of KIPs, and to discuss the results of a case study to evaluate KIPO with regard to its applicability and capability of making all relevant knowledge embedded in a KIP explicit.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Juliana Baptista dos Santos FrançaJoanne Manhães NettoJuliana do E. S. CarvalhoFlávia Maria SantoroFernanda Araujo BaiãoMariano Pimentel','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(130,'Policy chain for securing service oriented architectures','2013','3','Security of Service Oriented Architecture; Security Policy Management and Enforcement','Service Providers using Service Oriented Architecture in order to deliver in-house services as well as on-demand and cloud services have to deal with two interdependent challenges: (1) to achieve, maintain and prove compliance with security requirements stemming from internal needs, 3rd party demands and international regulations and (2) to manage requirements, policies and security configuration in a cost-efficient manner.

In this paper we investigate the composition of components that each on its own provide confidentiality of their data. We carve out that the complete behaviour between components needs to be considered, rather than focussing only on the single interaction points or the set of actions containing the confidential data. Our formal investigation reveals different possibilities for testing of correct compositions of components, for the coordinated distributed creation of composable components, and for the design of generally composable interfaces, ensuring the confidentiality of the composition.','',2,'Andreas FuchsSigrid Gürgens','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(134,'Dynamic Evolution of Context-Aware Systems with Models at Runtime','2012','4','','Abstract Model-driven techniques have proven to yield significant benefits for context-aware systems.

The paper describes a distributed architecture, suitable for modern web application development, as well as the interactivity components associated with it. Furthermore, we conducted a series of stress tests, on popular server side technologies. The PHP/Apache stack was found inefficient to address the increasing demand in network traffic. Nginx was found more than 2.5 times faster in input/output (I/O) operations than Apache, whereas Node.js outperformed both. Node.js, although excellent in I/O operations and resource utilization, was found lacking in serving static files using its built in HTTP server, while Nginx performed great at this task. So, in order to address efficiency, an Nginx server could be placed in-front and proxy static file requests, allowing the Node.js processes to only handle dynamic content. Such a configuration can offer a better infrastructure in terms of efficiency and scalability, replacing the aged PHP/Apache stack.

We propose to work towards value driven design by introducing a form of service design patterns, we call service value broker(SVB) patterns, with the aim to shorten the distance between economical analysis and IT implementation. SVB patterns allow us to not only study the value added in terms of functional and business aspects, but also reason about the need for brokerage across various domains. In this paper, we focus on modeling the basis of SVB. The analysis is provided with a formal development of SVB to be integrated across a variety of functional and business aspects of services.

Rational SMPC is a kind of SMPC in the presence of rational parties, who wish to maximize their utilities. Previous works about rational SMPC only studied the security properties under complete information scenario, where parties’ types are common knowledge. However, parties in practical applications have private types, which is unknown to others. This scenario is called incomplete information. In this paper, rational parties are allowed to have private types, which affect their utilities. Previously, rational parties obtain expected utilities due to unknown private types under incomplete information scenario. However, rational parties prefer to obtain pure utilities in actual life. To solve this contradiction, we use fuzzy theory to confirm the private type of his opponent; then they execute the protocol as if they know the private types just like the execution under complete information scenario. Consequently, they obtain pure utilities other than expected utility. In addition, our protocol can reduce round complexity than previous ones. Consequently, it will improve the security level and efficiency of cloud computing.','Soft Computing',1,'Yilei WangTao LiLufeng ChenPing LiHo-fung LeungZhe LiuQiuliang Xu','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(147,'An aspect-oriented framework for specification and enforcement of non-functional concerns in WS-BPEL','2012','','AO4BPEL; Aspects; Non-functional concerns; Reliable messaging; Security; Transactions; Web service composition; WS-BPEL','Web Service processes in WS-BPEL have several non-functional requirements such as security and reliable messaging.

Indeed, (1) SOA is mainly about reuse of assets; in this regard, legacy applications are running smoothly and performing critical tasks, (2) most of the business functions are locked within them, (3) legacy applications were built at high cost, and we need to preserve these investments, and (4) migration to SOA can give new life to legacy applications. A solution consists in extending the critical business logic of the legacy applications while preserving the investments, through their migration to Web services and SOA environments. This leads IT departments to select an appropriate modernization technique, which requires a guidance process to avoid any failure risk. The process would include analysis, selection of business functions, and wrapping. This work first surveys several types of approaches and automated tools that deal with one of the most modernization technique for SOA that is wrapping legacy applications into Web services. Next, it categorizes the wrapping techniques into session-based, transaction-based, and data-based wrapping techniques with regard to the three distinct parts of an application: presentation, logic, and data. This clear categorization assists in deciding an adequate technique. Then, it describes a practical guidance process for wrapping.

The approach maps each Web service into virtual space to distribute all QoS attributes among P2P nodes, and then designs a distributed decision tree to support range service query with QoS requirements. Finally, a load balance algorithm is used to reduce range query cost.

Current markets, e.g., app markets, are limited to basic keyword-based search although many better suitable matching approaches are described in literature. However, necessary architectural decisions for the integration of matchers have a huge impact on quality properties like performance or security. Architectural decisions wrt. service matchers have rarely been discussed, yet, and systematic approaches for their integration into service markets are missing.

Dynamic late biding makes SOC a very promising way to realize pervasive computing, which promotes the integration of computerized artifacts into the fabric of our daily lives. However, pervasive computing raises new challenges which SOC has not addressed yet. Pervasive application relies on highly dynamic and heterogeneous entities. They also necessitate an important data collection to compute the context of users and process sensitive data. Such data collection and processing raise well-known concerns about data disclosure and use. They are a brake to the development of widely accepted pervasive applications. SOC already permits to impose constraints on the bindings of services. We propose to add a new range of constraints to allow data privatization, i.e. the restriction of their disclosure. We extend the traditional design and binding phases of a Service-Oriented Architecture with the expression and the enforcement of privatization constraints. We express and enforce these constraints according to a two phases model-driven approach.

Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it\'s adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests.

An improper user-task assignment may prevent the completion of the workflow, and deciding such an assignment at runtime is known to be complex, especially when considering user unavailability (known as the resiliency problem). Therefore, design tools are required that allow fast evaluation of workflow resiliency. In this paper, we propose a methodology for workflow designers to assess the impact of the security policy on computing the resiliency of a workflow. Our approach relies on encoding a workflow into the probabilistic model-checker PRISM, allowing its resiliency to be evaluated by solving a Markov Decision Process. We observe and illustrate that adding or removing some constraints has a clear impact on the resiliency computation time, and we compute the set of security constraints that can be artificially added to a security policy in order to reduce the computation time while maintaining the resiliency.','',2,'John C.

Most of the current systems assume that Content Brokers are trusted for the confidentiality of the data published by Content Publishers and the privacy of the subscriptions, which specify their interests, made by Subscribers. However, with the increased use of technologies, such as service oriented architectures and cloud computing, essentially outsourcing the broker functionality to third-party providers, one can no longer assume the trust relationship to hold.

To achieve this objective, we have designed and developed the Smart Clinical Decision Support System (Smart CDSS) that takes input from diverse modalities, such as sensors, user profile information, social media, clinical knowledge bases, and medical experts to generate standards-based personalized recommendations. Smartphone-based, accelerometer-based, environment-based activity-recognition algorithms are developed with this system that recognizes users’ daily life activities. For example, social media data are captured for a diabetic patient from his/her social interactions on Twitter, e-mail, and Trajectory and then combined with clinical observations from real encounters in health-care facilities. The input is converted into standard interface following HL7 vMR standards and submitted to the Smart CDSS for it to generate recommendations. We tested the system for 100 patients from Saint Mary’s Hospital: 20 with type-1 diabetes, 40 with type-2 diabetes mellitus, and 40 with suspicions for diabetes but no diagnosis during clinical observations. The system knowledge base was initialized with standard guidelines from online resources for diabetes, represented in HL7 Arden syntax. The system generates recommendations based on physicians’ guidelines provided at the hospital during patient follow-ups. With support from the Azure cloud infrastructure, the system executed the set of guidelines represented in Arden syntax in a reasonable amount of time. Scheduling and executing the 3–5 guidelines called medical logic modules (MLMs) required less than a second.','Health and Technology',1,'M. HussainA. M. KhattakW. A. KhanI. FatimaM. B. AminZ.

Analyzing this data demands often significant custom scripting, as reuse of code is limited due to differences in input/output formats between both data sources and algorithms. This recurring need to write data-handling code significantly hinders fast data exploration. We argue that this problem cannot be solved by just data integration and standardization alone. We propose that the integration-analysis chain misses a link: a query solution which can operate on diversely structured data throughout the whole bioinformatics workflow, rather than just on data available in the data sources. We describe how a simple concept (shared ’dimensions’) allows such a query language to be constructed, enabling it to handle flat, nested and multi-dimensional data. Due to this, one can operate in a unified way on the outputs of algorithms and the contents of files and databases, directly structuring the data in a format suitable for further analysis. These ideas have been implemented in a prototype system called Ibidas. To retain flexibility, it is directly integrated into a scripting language. We show how this framework enables the reuse of common data operations in different problem settings, and for different data interfaces, thereby speeding up data exploration.','',1,'Marc HulsmanJan J.

However, when formulating a BM for networked enterprises, the alignment of the collective BM, supporting the joint service or product on offer, and the underlying operational processes of the networked businesses, need to be taken into account. This paper analyses the concept of Business Model Alignment (BMA) based on qualitative case studies of two Smart Living projects in Finland and China. To begin with, a Business Model framework (STOF) is applied to describe the high-level BM. Next, the Value, Information and Process (VIP) framework is applied to analyse BMA. The case studies show that an analytical framework, such as the VIP model, helps reveal the hurdles that may undermine BMA and, as a result, obstruct BM implementation. This paper contributes to existing BM literature by identifying the steps that are necessary to move from an abstract, often strategy-driven BM, of collaborating enterprises towards an aligned BM that can be implemented.

With our implementation, the proxy services witl be generated automatically for each target Grid service. Thus, they are not limited to pre-defined Grid services. In addition, our proxy services also remove design-time binding limitations of BPEL and allow user to define the binding information of proxy services in run-time. As our approach utilizes original BPEL specification without special modification, we believe that developing Grid applications on our architecture will benefit from standard BPEL-compliant tools and generic Web services tools.

In a model-driven engineering methodology, detecting occurrences of design patterns supports the activities of model comprehension and maintenance. With the recent explosion of domain-specific modeling languages, each with its own syntax and semantics, there has been a corresponding explosion in approaches to detecting design patterns that are so much tailored to those many languages that they are difficult to reuse. This makes developing generic analysis tools extremely hard. Such a generic tool is however desirable to reduce the learning curve for pattern designers as they specify patterns for different languages used to model different aspects of a system. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to detecting design patterns of MOF-based modeling languages. MOF is increasingly used to define modeling languages, including UML and BPMN. In our approach, a pattern is modeled with a Visual Pattern Modeling Language and mapped to a corresponding QVT-Relations transformation. Such a transformation runs over an input model where pattern occurrences are to be detected and reports those occurrences in a result model. The approach is prototyped on Eclipse and validated in two large case studies that involve detecting design patterns—specifically a subset of GoF patterns in a UML model and a subset of Control Flow patterns in a BPMN model. Results show that the approach is adequate for modeling complex design patterns for MOF-based modeling languages and detecting their occurrences with high accuracy and performance.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Maged ElaasarLionel C.

The monitoring is performed by checking the actual services performance against the QoS stated in Service Level Agreement (SLA). In relation to that, the need for monitoring vague QoS specifications in SLA has become more apparent nowadays. This paper reviews the published literature on web services QoS monitoring. A total of 60 selected articles were systematically analyzed. There were 23 of the articles selected through restrictive search criteria while the other 37 were selected based on unrestrictive search criteria. The review shows that little evidence exists on monitoring vague QoS specifications of web services. Providing ability for monitoring QoS that is specified vaguely in SLA could give new insights and implications to web services field.

An IS that satisfies all the functional requirements can be rejected by end-users if it presents usability problems. Unusable User Interface (UI) is probably the main reason that may lead to the failure in the actual use of an IS. Therefore, several approaches dealing with the evaluation of the user interface usability have been proposed in literature. However, these approaches are focused on the final system and require a large amount of resources to perform the evaluation (end-users, video cameras, questionnaires, etc.). The ability to go back and makes major changes to the design is greatly reduced. It is widely accepted that the evaluation performed at the beginning of the development process is a critical part of ensuring that the product will be used and effective for its intended purpose. In addition, an early usability evaluation would be a significant advantage with regard to saving time and resources. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the integration of the usability issues at an early stage of the development process.

Current applications of Cloud involve extensive use of distributed systems with varying degree of connectivity and usage. With a recent focus on large-scale proliferation of Cloud computing, identity management in Cloud based systems is a critical issue for the sustainability of any Cloud-based service. This area has also received considerable attention from the research community as well as the IT industry. Numerous Cloud Identity Management Systems (IDMSs) have been proposed so far; however, most of those systems are neither widely accepted nor considered highly reliable due to their constraints in terms of scope, applicability and security. In order to achieve reliability and effectiveness in IDMs for Cloud, further extensive research needs to be carried out to critically examine Cloud based IDMSs and their level of security. Methods In this work, we have holistically analyzed Cloud IDMSs to better understand the general as well as the security aspects of this domain. From the security perspective, we present a comprehensive list of attacks that occur frequently in Cloud based IDMSs. In order to alleviate those attacks, we present a well-organized taxonomy tree covering the most desired features essential for any Cloud-based IDMSs. Additionally, we have specified various mechanisms of realization (such as access control polices, encryption, self-service) against each of the features of Cloud IDMSs. We have further used the proposed taxonomy as an assessment criterion for the evaluation of Cloud based IDMSs. Results Our in-depth analysis of various Cloud based IDMSs reveals that most of the systems do not offer support to all the essential features of Cloud IDMS and the ones that do, have their own certain weaknesses. None of the discussed techniques heuristically covers all the security features; moreover, they lack compliance to international standards which, understandably, undermines their credibility. Conclusion Presented work will help Cloud subscribers and providers in understanding the available solutions as well as the involved risks, allowing them to make more knowledgeable decisions while selecting potential Cloud IDMSs that best suits their functional and security requirements.','Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling',1,'Umme HabibaRahat MasoodMuhammad Awais ShibliMuaz A Niazi','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(210,'An environment for service composition, execution and resource allocation','2013','','service composition; Service Oriented Architecture; service request distribution; service security','In recent years the evolution of software architectures led to the rising prominence of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concept.

The choice of Service Oriented Architecture and Web Services provides a cost effective and scalable solution to integrate disparate software elements of the ground system.

Most of the previous research efforts on service discovery have been based on the ternary classification of participant roles in web services, including service providers, brokers, and consumers. This classification is insufficient because it fails to make a difference between application developers and end users who both belong to service consumers. As a result, application developers usually take the responsibility of seeking services while end users who ultimately use the application are ignored. In order to address this issue, this paper presents an Intents-based approach for dynamic service discovery. The proposed approach is motivated from two industrial protocols: Android Intents and web Intents. It improves the two protocols by a generic model from the aspects of architecture, intent messages and their resolving process, Intents services, and user agents. It classifies the implicit intents into authoritative and naïve intents and is compatible with the current web service triangular architecture. This paper also illustrates a way of creating Intents services from SOAP and REST web services and presents two cases to demonstrate some benefits of the proposed approach.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Cheng ZhengWeiming ShenHamada H.

In dynamic Web services composition, failures and changes to atomic services cannot be detected before invocation. Hence, the failure or even the change in an atomic service may lead to the overall failure of the composite service. In addition, SOAP error code is not sufficient for the client to analyze the failure reason and handle it. In this work, we introduce a framework to deal with unexpected failures during runtime composition. The proposed framework is built on top of composite services stack as an interface between the composite service and its external service partners. The evaluation results show that by using the proposed framework, it is possible to avoid composite service failures that are caused by changes or failures in atomic services.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Mohamed El KholyAhmed El Fatatry','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(214,'SeSaMe: Towards a Semantic Self Adaptive Middleware for Smart Spaces','2013','2','','Abstract Smart spaces are inherently complex and dynamic systems, where diverse devices, sensors, actuators and computational elements need to interact with one another. A middleware infrastructure can provide suitable abstractions that simplify the task, and allow designers to ignore the details of the underlying elements.

In this paper we propose SeSaMe, a semantic and self-adaptive middleware infrastructure for highly dynamic and massive smart spaces. SeSaMe establishes a “backbone” to let components connect to the system without any prior knowledge of its topology. It is capable of maintaining the system’s overall reliability, even when multiple components leave or fail unexpectedly, and of coping with message congestion, by dynamically altering the system’s topology. SeSaMe also provides a simple declarative language for defining how one wants the system to evolve over time, and semantic technologies for harmonizing the interaction of different kinds of components. The main new features of SeSaMe are exemplified on two example smart spaces with significantly different characteristics.','',1,'Luciano BaresiSam GuineaAdnan Shahzada','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(215,'Scope-Aware Delegations in Distributed Social Networks','2015','1',' Security Delegation Semantic web Social web WebID','Abstract Swiftly meeting challenges by distributing tasks to the most suitable knowledge workers is an important matter, especially for network-centric organizations.

However, commercially available cloud services such as public grids target the needs for the broader customer base and do not meet the specialized requirements of real-time, data-centric applications, such as sensor data aggregation, messaging, media streaming and commodity exchange, that need to process very large volumes of diverse, streaming data in near real time. To make matters worse, end-to-end communication paths between real-time data providers and consumers are no longer guaranteed, due to either node unavailability or service unavailability. The DTN paradigm has shown to promote interoperable and reliable communications in the presence of disruptions, however, is not directly applicable to cloud computing. A new cloud computing model is therefore needed for the above scenarios. This paper proposes a novel concept, that of a generalized cloud, Cirrus , defined as a computing cloud with the following characteristics: (i) abiding by the NIST Cloud Definition, (ii) providing specialized, core Cloud services targeted to real-time, data centric applications, (iii) allowing for the elastic use of Cirrus cloud resources by ad-hoc networks and (iv) allowing for the elastic incorporation of nomadic and/or severely resource constrained devices, in Cirrus. Cirrus is built on top of DTN application-layer extensions, such as the Bundle Protocol (BP). As a result, Cirrus behaves as an ”overlay Cloud”, elastically forming, expanding and shrinking over networks of dynamic topology that may contain both fixed and ad-hoc infrastructure, thus providing a more fair and de-centralized Cloud Computing solution that is not exclusive to ”big players” in the field.','',1,'Eleftheria Katsiri','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(225,'Proceedings - 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications, TrustCom 2013','2013','','','The proceedings contain 256 papers.

The JIAC V framework tries to bridge that gap—not as a final solution, but as a stepping stone towards industrial acceptance.','',2,'Marco LützenbergerTobias KüsterThomas KonnerthAlexander ThieleNils MasuchAxel HeßlerJan KeiserMichael BurkhardtSilvan KaiserJakob TonnMichael KaisersSahin Albayrak','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer','\0'),(229,'Doctoral dissertations in logistics and supply chain management: a review of Nordic contributions from 2009 to 2014','2016','0',' Doctoral dissertations Collection of articles Monographs Dissertation score Logistics and supply chain management','Abstract The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze Nordic doctoral dissertations in logistics and supply chain management (SCM) published from the years 2009–2014.

It was originally defined as connected all the things through the sensing devices to the Internet. In addition, Service-Oriented methodology has gradually drawn people\'s attention. Therefore, integrated The IOT with Service-Oriented methodology is very important. But now IOT service composition is mostly synchronous and service model is more complex. RESTful web services have been widely recognized and used because of their lightweight and succinct. RESTful web services introduce a new kind of abstraction, the resource, so that they are hard to compose using the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). In order to compose asynchronous RESTful web services and make use of various IOT services, this paper proposes an asynchronous RESTful web service recursive measure, which is based on the BPEL extention. First, design the architecture of IOT RESTful web services, the architecture is divided into six layers so that it can integrate The IOT and RESTful web services effectively. Second, we show how to invoke the RESTful web services from the IOT and publish a BPEL process as a RESTful web service by extending BPEL.

Such heterogeneity is especially true of service-oriented systems, which are often dynamic in nature and composed of multiple interacting services. However, in order to establish user trust in such systems, there is a need to determine the validity and reliability of all the data sources that go into the making of a decision. This paper analyses the concept of provenance and discusses how the establishment of personalized provenance recording and retrieval systems can be used to increase the utility of data and engender user trust in complex service-based systems. An overview of current provenance research is presented, and a real-world project to address the abstract concepts of trust and data quality in industrial and clinical settings is presented. From this, we conclude that the addition of provenance into data processing and decision making systems can have a tangible benefit to improving the trust of system users.','Object/Component/Service-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing Workshops (ISORCW), 2012 15th IEEE International Symposium on',1,'P.

There are a couple of reasons for this restrained progress. Traditionally, medical devices are either both small-sized and self-sufficient or they are highly integrated parts of a complete setup provided by one vendor. Especially when equipping critical care facilities such as intensive care units, producer and brand diversity is low, whereas the pressure of competition is high. The results are proprietary communication and control solutions when connecting devices in order to interact. On the other hand, any modern hospital heavily relies on highly available critical medical devices providing and sharing data but also on confidentiality and integrity of vitally important information. This paper discusses a pragmatic risk-based approach to handle integration problems facing the current situation described above, while focusing on future development challenges. The background of this paper is a project for defining a safe and secure integration interface that – open to integration partners – enables to monitor and remote-control a critical medical device.','',1,'Christoph Woskowski','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(237,'IoT6 – Moving to an IPv6-Based Future IoT','2013','7',' IoT M2M IPv6 CoAP architecture interoperability building automation','Abstract IoT6 is a research project on the future Internet of Things.

Such an approach requires a careful selection of a set of services for realizing a particular distributed software system. Hence, identifying and quantifying the trust of such publically available services becomes a prerequisite for composing distributed software systems. The quantification of the trust associated with a service is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of trust, lack of standards, and associated uncertainty. Moreover, the trust of a service is not a static value and should be updated periodically. To achieve a proper quantification of a trust associated with a service, there is a need to periodically collect, monitor, and aggregate various evidences available about that service. This paper augments previously defined quantification of the trust by monitoring and aggregating various available evidences. This enhanced approach is used to improve the service selection process.

Physicians continue to initiate this learning process by taking into account the history of the patient’s medical problems and physical examination findings in the patient’s medical record, which illustrates the importance of medical and health care databases. In other side, the evolution of medical data volume needs to be modeled using data warehouses. A medical data warehouse is a particular database targeted toward decision support. It takes data from various medical databases and other data sources and transforms it into new structures that fit better for the task of performing the decision making. For this reason, the medical database and data warehouse models needed to produce a formal description, a conceptual schema of all the data generated in medical and health care institutions, and how all of the data were related. However, it is still difficult to find references models, since classical conceptual modeling does not incorporate the specificity of the medical field. The design phase is the most important activity in the successful building of a database and a data warehouse. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a new modeling framework based on an UML profile, called medical profile. This profile was proposed to standardize the task of medical data modeling, using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) extensibility mechanisms. Our proposal is aligned with model driven architecture (MDA), thus permitting to define and clarify all concepts and elements related to medical field including the medical image annotation process. To show the benefits of our profile, we develop an example related to the medical image annotation process.

We evaluate our framework impact by inquiring the specialists about the degree of confidence in our framework.

This work presents RT-SPDM, a framework for the real-time management of devices populating ambient environments. The proposed framework utilizes a formally validated approach to reason the composability of heterogeneous embedded systems, evaluate their current security, privacy and dependability levels based on pre-defined metrics, and manage them in real-time. An implementation of Event Calculus is used in the Jess rule engine in order to model the ambient environment context and the rule-based management procedure. The reasoning process is modeled as an agent’s behavior and applied on an epistemic multi-agent reasoner for ambient intelligence applications. Agents monitor distinct embedded systems and are deployed as OSGi bundles to enhance the real-time management of embedded devices. A Service Oriented Architecture is adopted, through the use of the Devices Profile for Web Services standard, in order to provide seamless interaction between the framework’s entities, which exchange well-formed information, determined by the OASIS CAP standard. Proof-of-concept implementations of all entities are developed, also investigating user-friendly GUIs for both the front-end and back-end of the framework.

To effectively handle the explosive growth of images involved in social discovery, one common trend for many emerging social media sites is to leverage the commercial public cloud as their robust backend data center. While extremely convenient, directly exposing content-rich images and the related social discovery results to the public cloud also raises new acute privacy concerns. In light of the observation, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving social discovery service architecture based on encrypted images. As the core of such social discovery is to compare and quantify similar images, we first adopt the effective Bag-of-Words model to extract the \"visual similarity content\" of users\' images into image profile vectors, and then model the problem as similarity retrieval of encrypted high-dimensional image profiles. To support fast and scalable similarity search over hundreds of thousands of encrypted images, we propose a secure and efficient indexing structure. The resulting design enables social media sites to obtain secure, practical, and accurate social discovery from the public cloud, without disclosing the encrypted image content. We formally prove the security and discuss further extensions on user image update and the compatibility with existing image sharing social functionalities. Extensive experiments on a large Flickr image dataset demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed design. Our qualitative social discovery results show consistency with human perception.','Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), 2014 IEEE 34th International Conference on',1,'X. Yuan; X. Wang; C. Wang; A.

Indeed, at present, the main limitation in this respect consists of the vast majority of data sources being served on a “best effort” basis. To overcome this limitation, we propose a “resilient and adaptive IoT and social sensing platform”. Resilience guarantees the accurate, timely and dependable delivery of the complete/related data required by smart-city applications, while adaptability is introduced to ensure optimal handling of the changing requirements during application provision. The associated middleware consists of two main sets of functionalities: (a) formulation of sensing requests: selection and discovery of the appropriate data sources; and (b) establishment and control of the necessary resources (e.g., smart objects, networks, computing/storage points) on the delivery path from sensing devices to the requesting applications. The middleware has the intrinsic feature of producing sensing information at a certain level of detail (geographical scope/timeliness/accuracy/completeness/dependability) as requested by the applications in a given domain. The middleware is assessed and validated at a proof-of-concept level through innovative, dependable and real-time applications expected to be highly reproducible across different cities.','Wireless Personal Communications',1,'Javier PoncelaPanagiotis VlacheasRaffaele GiaffredaSuparna DeMassimo VecchioSeptimiu NechiforRaquel BarcoMari Carmen Aguayo-TorresVera StavroulakiKlaus MoessnerPanagiotis Demestichas','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(267,'A smart citizen healthcare assistant framework','2013','1',' Health informatics Social care systems Personal health assistance service Resident assessment instrument Minimum data set Care plan u_Health m_Health Personal health records Enterprise mashup Distributed database management system','Abstract This paper focuses on the development of a citizen-oriented lifelong healthcare assistant system, which will support not only health Care Delivery Organizations (CDOs) but also health care providers.

Society needs to address this issue of automatic recognition and find a balanced solution that is able to meet its various needs and concerns. In the post 9/11 period, population security and safety considerations have given rise to research needs for identification of threatening human activities and emotional behaviours.Timely identification of human intent is one of the most challenging areas of \"all-hazards\" risk assessment in the protection of critical infrastructure, business continuity planning and community safety. The \"all-hazards\" approach is used extensively by the public and private sector, including Public Safety Canada (PS Canada -- formerly PSEPC), Emergency Management Ontario (EMO), US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).There is a clear need for industry and the research community to addresses fundamental issues involved in the prevention of human-made disasters, namely the variable context-dependent, real-time detection/identification of potential threatening behaviour of humans, acting individually or in crowded environments.Such an industry and academia forum will have to discuss development and commercialization of new multimodal (video and infrared, voice and sound, RFID and perimeter intrusion) intelligent sensor technologies for location and socio-cultural context-aware security risk assessment and decision support in human-crowd surveillance applications in environments such as school campuses, hospitals, shopping centers, subways or railway stations, airports, sports and artistic arenas etc. Due to the complexity of the surveillance task, there is a clear need for the development of a distributed intelligent surveillance system architecture, which combines visual and audio surveillance based on wireless sensor nodes equipped with video or infrared (IR) cameras, audio detectors, or other object detection and motion sensors with location aware wireless sensor network solutions. The integration of visual, sound and radio tracking methods results in a highly intelligent, proactive, and adaptive surveillance and security solution sensor networks. Task-directed sensor data collection and observation planning algorithms need to be developed to allow for a more elastic and efficient use of the inherently limited sensing and processing capabilities. Each task a sensor has to carry out determines the nature and the level of the information that is actually needed. There is a need for \"selective environment perception\" methods that focus on object parameters that are important for the specific decision to be made for the task at hand and avoid wasting effort to process irrelevant data.Multisensor data fusion techniques should be investigated for the dynamic integration of the multi-thread flow of information provided by the heterogeneous network of surveillance sensors into a coherent multimodal model of the monitored human crowd.In the context of crowds, robust tracking of people represents an important challenge. The numerous sources of occlusions and the large diversity of interactions that might occur make difficult the long-term tracking of a particular individual over an extended period of time and using a network of sensors. Realtime image processing and computer-vision algorithms need to be studied for the identification, tracking and recognition of gait and other relevant body-language patterns of the human agents who can be deemed of interest for security reasons. Real-time signal processing algorithms have to be designed for the identification and evaluation of environmental and human-subject multimodal parameters (such as human gait, gestures, facial emotions, human voice, background sound, ambient light, etc.) that provide the contextual information for the specific surveillance activity.A multidisciplinary, context-aware, situation-assessment system, including human behaviour, cognitive psychology, multicultural sociology, learning systems, artificial intelligence, distributed multimedia and software design elements, has to be ultimately developed for the real-time evaluation of the activity and emotional behaviour of the human subjects identified as being potentially of security interest in the monitored dynamic environment.The development of such a complex system requires the seamless integration of new and improved surveillance techniques and methodologies supporting both functional and non functional requirements for surveillance networks. Functional requirements are signal processing functions and data fusion, archiving and tracking human behaviours, assessment and interpretation functions of the data, and supporting human decision makers, among others. Non-functional requirements include interoperability, scalability, availability, and manageability.The partial and heterogeneous sensor-views of the environment have to fuse into a coherent Virtualized Reality Environment (VRE) model of the explored environment. Being based on information about real/physical world objects and phenomena, as captured by a variety of sensors, VREs have more \"real content\" than the pure Virtual Reality environments entirely based on computer simulations. The VREs model of the explored environment allows human operators to combine their intrinsic reactive-behaviour with higher-order world model representations of the immersive VRE systems.A synthetic environment will eventually be needed to provide efficient multi granularity-level function-specific feedback and human-computer interaction interfaces for the human users who are the final assessors and decision makers in the specific security monitoring situation.An ideal system should provide efficient multi granularity-level function-specific feedback for the human users who are the final assessors and decision makers in the specific security monitoring situation.The rate at which surveillance systems can currently disseminate data to evaluate new threats is mainly limited due to the developed and implemented nature of existing systems and their limited ability to operate with other systems.

Electronic Tendering (e-tendering), is one such application through which calls, proposals, bids and reviews are exchanged between interested parties for securing a project that is published via a tender management system. Few e-tendering systems exist that automate all the processes. Although, techniques have been developed to provide the basic exchange of documents and messaging service, very little research and application has been done in the area of authentication, secure exchange of data, and storage of tender applications in multi-user environments. Our work focuses on developing a holistic solution for meeting the security requirements of e-tendering system. We first investigate the main drawbacks of using SSL for such applications, and also highlight the threats, attacks and implementation issues encountered in implementing systems without SSL. In this paper we propose a novel mechanism to overcome the drawbacks, focusing on the e-tendering steps related to authentication, submission of bid proposal, data transmission and key exchange between trusted parties, and secure data storage. In each of these steps, we identify the possible attacks and propose novel ways to apply techniques so that the security needs are met. We believe that our application of techniques, use of key exchange in e-tendering, and other algorithms provides a practical mechanism for secure e-tendering in open electronic networks.

A major issue in this scenario relates to the definition of an assurance technique allowing clients to select services on the basis of their nonfunctional requirements and increasing their confidence that the selected services will satisfy such requirements. In this article, we first present an assurance solution that focuses on security and supports a test-based security certification scheme for Web services.

While there is no clear consensus on how roles should be represented, a survey of the literature suggests that we should address both responsibilities and rights in the modeling of roles [1]. Based on this, we argue that the responsibilities and rights of roles can be captured by leveraging the notions of business contract and goal (in the sense of the goals of an actor being constrained by the rights associated with the role played by the actor) in the realm of requirements engineering. We leverage existing work on the formalization of business contracts [2] and the formulation of goals in the i * modeling framework [3]. We devise formal techniques for reasoning about the composition and substitutability of roles and illustrate them through a running example.','',2,'Lam-Son LêAditya Ghose','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer','\0'),(287,'Design and implementation of ONVIF-based event service for DM 814x camera','2015','','camera; Event service; ONVIF; webservice','Nowadays, IP-based physical security products like IP network camera (IPNC) are becoming essential in construction of a modern security system. In order to guarantee interoperability among them, ONVIF has been a de facto standard communication framework. In addition to core specification, ONVIF defines many services. ONVIF Event service is supposed to provide notification messages to registered clients when events happen, which is an essential mechanism to be support to make IPNC intelligent. Currently, we are developing a smart IPNC based on TI DM814x media processor. In this paper, we report our efforts to implement ONVIF Event service for the smart IPNC. First, we design S/W architecture, necessary data structures, and workflow of ONVIF Event service according to ONVIF Event service specification. Then, we implement the design about ONVIF Event service by extending TI\'s IPNC reference RDK S/W package.

Ontology base refers to a set of ontologies that include subject ontology, resource ontology, environment ontology, and action ontology. In the access policy module, we describe the access policy with eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) model, which allows users to achieve access rule reproduction by defining the semantic scope and inference rules among different entities. Results of the analysis indicate that indicates that our model expands the scopes of authorization rules for users. Inference of semantic authorization rules is also realized. These rules enable fine-grained access to data and meet the need for dynamic change of HCLS Linked Data. Finally, we show the process of authorization and present a system framework.

There are several studies on the modeling and its theoretical aspects; however, the possible realization of this approach in a particular technology is still in its fancy stage.

It aims to provide targeted and personalized support for informal caregivers of people with dementia in a home-based care setting. The objective of the pilot study was to obtain feedback on the eHM-DP from two user perspectives (caregivers and medical professionals), focusing on caregiver empowerment, decision aid, and the perceived benefits of the eHM-DP. Methods The study on the eHM-DP was conducted from March 2014 to June 2014. The methodological approach followed a user-participatory design with a total number of 42 participants. The study included caregivers of people with dementia and medical professionals (MPs) from the metropolitan region of Erlangen-Nürnberg (Bavaria, Germany). Study participants were interviewed face-to-face with semi-structured, written interviews. Results Caregivers indicated a high degree of perceived support by the eHM-DP and of provided decision aid. In total, 89 % of caregivers and 54 % of MPs would use the eHM-DP if access were provided. The primary benefits participants perceived were the acquisition of individualized information, computerized interaction between caregivers and MPs, empowerment in health-related decisions and comprehensive insights into the progress of the disease. Major recommendations for improving the eHM-DP encompassed: an active search functionality based on predefined terms, the implementation of a chatroom for caregivers, an upload function and alerts for MPs, as well as the overall design. Conclusions Our study is the first to have provided new insights and results on an interactive and needs-oriented web portal, endeavouring towards empowerment and assistance in decision making for caregivers as well as MPs within the realm of caring for patients with dementia. The acceptance and willingness to use the eHM-DP emphasizes the potential of eHealth services for community-based dementia care settings.','BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making',1,'Sandra SchallerVelislava Marinova-SchmidtJasmin GobinManfred Criegee-RieckLena GriebelSabine EngelVeronika SteinElmar GraesselPeter L Kolominsky-Rabas','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(297,'A mashup based framework for multi level healthcare interoperability','2012','2',' Interoperability Process interoperability Healthcare Collaboration Web 2.0 Mashups Systems design','Abstract Healthcare delivery is evolving from disease-centered to patient-centered care delivery where patients are active participants in their healthcare delivery.

This paper uses data from 50 projects performed at one of the largest banks in Sweden to identify factors that have an impact on software development cost. Correlation analysis of the relationship between factor states and project costs was assessed using ANOVA and regression analysis. Ten out of the original 31 factors turned out to have an impact on software development project cost at the Swedish bank including the: number of function points, involved risk, number of budget revisions, primary platform, project priority, commissioning body’s unit, commissioning body, number of project participants, project duration, and number of consultants. In order to be able to compare projects of different size and complexity, this study also considers the software development productivity defined as the amount of function points per working hour in a project. The study at the bank indicates that the productivity is affected by factors such as performance of estimation and prognosis efforts, project type, number of budget revisions, existence of testing conductor, presentation interface, and number of project participants. A discussion addressing how the productivity factors relate to cost estimation models and their factors is presented. Some of the factors found to have an impact on cost are already included in estimation models such as COCOMO II, TEAMATe, and SEER-SEM, for instance function points and software platform. Thus, this paper validates these well-known factors for cost estimation. However, several of the factors found in this study are not included in established models for software development cost estimation.

In general, a compliance rule may refer to multiple process perspectives including control flow, time, data, resources, and interactions with business partners. On one hand, compliance rules should be comprehensible for domain experts who must define, verify, and apply them. On the other, these rules should have a precise semantics to avoid ambiguities and enable their automated processing. Providing a visual language is advantageous in this context as it allows hiding formal details and offering an intuitive way of modeling the compliance rules. However, existing visual languages for compliance rule modeling have focused on the control flow perspective so far, but lack proper support for the other process perspectives. To remedy this drawback, this paper introduces the extended Compliance Rule Graph language, which enables the visual modeling of compliance rules with the support of multiple perspectives. Overall, this language will foster the modeling and verification of compliance rules in practice.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'David KnupleschManfred Reichert','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(302,'Upgradation of Business Applications with Autonomic Computing','2013','0','CRM, ERP, autonomic computing, e-commerce, multi-agent architecture, service oriented architecture','Autonomic computing has come a long way since its inception a decade ago and has been positioned as a venerable and value-adding technology for producing and sustaining self-managing, real-time, and resilient systems for the future.

A variety of proven and potential mathematical and computational concepts have been selected and synchronized to arrive at noteworthy improvements in the autonomic systems design, development, deployment, and delivery methods. Having understood the unique value-proposition and the significant achievements in the autonomic computing space, business executives and IT experts are consciously embracing the autonomic idea, which is very generic to be easily embedded in any kind of business and IT systems. However, the penetration of this technology into both IT and business applications has not been as originally envisaged by its creators due to various reasons.The business environment is still filled and saturated with large-scale packaged and monolithic applications.

Their major impact has been in characterising essential properties of communications such as freedom from deadlock and communication error, and buffer boundedness. CFSMs are known to be computationally hard: most of these properties are undecidable even in restricted cases. At the same time, multiparty session types are a recent typed framework whose main feature is its ability to efficiently enforce these properties for mobile processes and programming languages. This paper ties the links between the two frameworks to achieve a two-fold goal. On one hand, we present a generalised variant of multiparty session types that have a direct semantical correspondence to CFSMs. Our calculus can treat expressive forking, merging and joining protocols that are absent from existing session frameworks, and our typing system can ensure properties such as safety, boundedness and liveness on distributed processes by a polynomial time type checking. On the other hand, multiparty session types allow us to identify a new class of CFSMs that automatically enjoy the aforementioned properties , generalising Gouda et al’s work [12] (for two machines) to an arbitrary number of machines.','',2,'Pierre-Malo DeniélouNobuko Yoshida','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(316,'Compliance validation of secure service compositions','2014','1','BPMN; Compliance; SecureBPMN; Security; Validation','In this chapter, we present the Composition Security Validation Module (CSVM).

One of its key improvements over the Classic OPC is that the area of application is no longer restricted to industrial automation but OPC UA can be applied almost in every domain facing challenges in automated control. This improvement stems from a more generic and object-oriented approach. For the adoption of OPC UA to Smart Grids, two of the most important data models - the Common Information Model (CIM) and the IEC 61850 - have been identified to be integrated into OPC UA communication.

While such application development mode offers advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and flexibility, application developers cannot understand or deal with risks potentially resulting from vulnerabilities within composed services due to non-transparency of the service providers. Furthermore, some of the vulnerabilities in practice are deeply hidden in dependency structures underlying composed services, thus making even the service providers fail to know the vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a risk-evaluation assisted service selection system, called Risk Evaluation-as-a-Service(or REaaS), which aims to assist application developers to understand vulnerability risks hidden within alternative services when the developers at first attempt to adopt their applications. In particular, for a given application developer\'s service selection requirement, REaaS produces a ranking list based upon vulnerability risks of alternative services to serve as a guideline regarding which service has the lowest potential risks (e.g., Bugs) for this application deployment. REaaS achieves this goal through the following three steps: 1) generating a package dependency graph for each alternative service, 2) assigning threat-degrees to packages in each dependency graph, and 3) analyzing each dependency graph and evaluating service-risk of each service.

This promises to save a significant amount of individual development cost. The biggest obstacle to using this technology is the problem of trust. To gain trust in the services offered they have to be extensively tested, either by the user himself or by a trusted agent. This chapter deals with the testing of web services in the cloud. There are many similarities to testing web services in a local service-oriented architecture, but there are also significant differences. In a company specific SOA, testers can gain access to the source. This is not true of the cloud. There is no possibility of accessing the source. Therefore, testers must rely solely on the specification contained in the service level agreement - SLA - and the web service interface definition - WSDL or REST - to base their test upon. Testing in the cloud is strictly a black-box test. The goal of a cloud service test is also not to find errors but to assess the suitability of the service to the purpose of the user. It may be necessary to test several services in order to find that one best suited to the requirements of the user. To judge suitability it is necessary to define an ideal usage profile, including performance, security and other non-functional criteria, and to compare that with the actual profile of each potential service. For this both static and dynamic analysis methods must be applied.

In this paper, we propose a property-based approach to testing encryption programs in the absence of oracles. Our approach makes use of the so-called metamorphic properties of encryption algorithms to generate test cases and verify test results. Two case studies were conducted to illustrate the proposed approach and validate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that even without oracles, the proposed approach can detect nearly 50% inserted faults with at most three metamorphic relations (MRs) and fifty test cases.','Frontiers of Computer Science',1,'Chang-ai SunZuoyi WangGuan Wang','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(353,'Data flow-oriented process mining to support security audits','2012','1','','The automated execution of dynamically-evolving business processes in service-oriented architectures requires audit methods to assert that they fulfill required security properties.

Agents need to negotiate on the basis of a set of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like duration, availability, price etc. as required by the user. On completion of the negotiation process, user receives a feedback from the agent regarding the probability of negotiation.

Along with cloud computing, many related problems come up. And these problems in turn slow the speed of the development of cloud computing down. Among these problems, e.g. interoperability and privacy, identity management and security are strong concerned. Many researchers and enterprises have already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it\'s adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy.

Most of the existing solutions in this field assume that peers interact synchronously using rendezvous communication. However, many application areas rely on asynchronous communication models where peers interact exchanging messages via buffers.

This paper studies the problem of how to efficiently search and select trustworthy service providers for users in social networks consisting of service providers and consumers. A trust value between two participants can be derived by existing methods from the optimal trust path between them in a social network. When more than one trust factors are taken into consideration, the exact optimal trust path selection algorithm is NP-complete. Although several heuristic algorithms have been proposed to find approximate solutions, their time complexities are still too high to be acceptable in practice, especially when they are used in very large scale social networks. Focusing on reducing trust path searching time, this paper proposes an efficient preprocessing-based search strategy. It exploits structural properties of the social networks and builds an advanced data structure from preprocessing, which can be used to simplify and accelerate the trust path searching. Experimental results show our strategy is very efficient and nearly achieves a constant time complexity. The computed trustworthiness based on our method has excellent performance close to that of the best existing heuristic algorithm.','Services Computing (SCC), 2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on',1,'Y.

Intensive Care platforms require a timely processing of data retrievals to guarantee the continuous display of recent data of patients. Physicians and nurses rely on this data for their decision making. Manual optimization of query executions has become difficult to handle due to the increased amount of queries across multiple sources. Hence, a more automated management is necessary to increase the performance of database queries. The autonomic computing paradigm promises an approach in which the system adapts itself and acts as self-managing entity, thereby limiting human interventions and taking actions. Despite the usage of autonomic control loops in network and software systems, this approach has not been applied so far for health information systems. Methods We extend the COSARA architecture, an infection surveillance and antibiotic management service platform for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), with self-managed components to increase the performance of data retrievals. We used real-life ICU COSARA queries to analyse slow performance and measure the impact of optimizations. Each day more than 2 million COSARA queries are executed. Three control loops, which monitor the executions and take action, have been proposed: reactive, deliberative and reflective control loops. We focus on improvements of the execution time of microbiology queries directly related to the visual displays of patients’ data on the bedside screens. Results The results show that autonomic control loops are beneficial for the optimizations in the data executions in the ICU. The application of reactive control loop results in a reduction of 8.61% of the average execution time of microbiology results. The combined application of the reactive and deliberative control loop results in an average query time reduction of 10.92% and the combination of reactive, deliberative and reflective control loops provides a reduction of 13.04%. Conclusions We found that by controlled reduction of queries’ executions the performance for the end-user can be improved. The implementation of autonomic control loops in an existing health platform, COSARA, has a positive effect on the timely data visualization for the physician and nurse.','BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making',1,'Kristof SteurbautSteven LatréJohan DecruyenaereFilip De Turck','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(363,'Experiences with Arthron for Live Surgery Transmission in Brazilian Telemedicine University Network','2013','0',' New Technology and its Usefulness eHealth and Telemedicine Systems','Abstract The increasing network bandwidth capacity and the diminishing costs of related services have led to a rising number of applications in the field of Information and Communication Technology.

However, as sensor nodes are failure prone, this consequently renders the whole wireless sensor network to seriously faulty. When a particular node is faulty, the service on it should be migrated into those substitute sensor nodes that are in a normal status. Currently, two kinds of approaches exist to identify the substitute sensor nodes: the most common approach is to prepare redundancy nodes, though the involved tasks such as maintaining redundancy nodes, i.e., relocating the new node, lead to an extra burden on the wireless sensor networks. More recently, other approaches without using redundancy nodes are emerging, and they merely select the substitute nodes in a sensor node’s perspective i.e., migrating the service of faulty node to it’s nearest sensor node, though usually neglecting the requirements of the application level. Even a few work consider the need of the application level, they perform at packets granularity and don’t fit well at service granularity. In this paper, we aim to remove these limitations in the wireless sensor network with the service-oriented architecture. Instead of deploying redundancy nodes, the proposed mechanism replaces the faulty sensor node with consideration of the similarity on the application level, as well as on the sensor level. On the application level, we apply the Bloom Filter for its high efficiency and low space costs. While on the sensor level, we design an objective solution via the coefficient of a variation as an evaluation for choosing the substitute on the sensor level.','Journal of Network and Systems Management',1,'Qian LiWenjia NiuGang LiEndong TongYue HuPing LiuLi Guo','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(365,'Systematic literature review of the objectives, techniques, kinds, and architectures of models at runtime','2016','0',' Models Runtime Literature review','Abstract In the context of software development, models provide an abstract representation of a software system or a part of it.

At runtime, consumers have different dynamic requirements about those properties that constitute quality of information (QoI) for them.

We introduce the generic concept of expectations to express, negotiate and enforce arbitrary requirements about information quality in EBS at runtime. In this paper, we present the model of expectations, capabilities and feedback based on generic properties. Participants express requirements and define individual tradeoffs between them as expectations while system features are expressed as capabilities.

Security is still a big concern that prevents many to \"cloudify\" their applications and put their data in the hands of a cloud provider. Also, interoperable scenarios fostered by SOA technologies exacerbate the security question, as customers have to deal with multiple providers who, in their turn, must establish mutual trust relationships in order to interoperate. In the last few years, policies are being used as a means to build networks of trustiness among cloud providers. Standards and specifications on security management through policies have also appeared. We argue that the main problem with this approach is that policies are expressed through syntactic languages which, if processed by computers, show well-known limitations. We then propose an approach that leverages on the semantic technologies to enrich security policies with semantic contents enabling machine reasoning. The framework we developed caters for the security needs of both customers and providers, and aims at making a smart match between what is requested and what is offered in terms of security. On the customer side, no extra effort is required other than specifying their security policies according to well-established security notations; an automatic procedure is charged of adding semantic content to the policies.','',1,'Di Modica G., Tomarchio O.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(387,'SDE-driven service provision control','2012','','Differential Evolution; Service Provision Control; Stochastic differential equation','The service-oriented architecture (SOA) allows distributed resources to be provided through standard service interfaces, resulting in easy and flexible access to domain-specific functionality.

The growing market penetration, with an evermore diverse provider and service landscape, turns Cloud computing marketplaces a highly competitive one. In this highly competitive and distributed service environment, the assurances are insufficient for the consumers to identify the dependable and trustworthy Cloud providers. This paper provides a landscape and discusses incentives and hindrances to adopt Cloud computing from Cloud consumers’ perspective. Due to these hindrances, potential consumers are not sure whether they can trust the Cloud providers in offering dependable services. Trust-aided unified evaluation framework by leveraging trust and reputation systems can be used to assess trustworthiness (or dependability) of Cloud providers. Hence, cloud-related specific parameters (QoS + ) are required for the trust and reputation systems in Cloud environments. We identify the essential properties and corresponding research challenges to integrate the QoS + parameters into trust and reputation systems. Finally, we survey and analyse the existing trust and reputation systems in various application domains, characterizing their individual strengths and weaknesses.

Web services based on open standards are the most commonly used technology to realize an SOA. Business processes are executed by appropriate orchestration of various services from different departments that belong to a single organization or from multiple organizations. Security is an important quality attribute that has to be built into any application that is developed using SOA. XML is the underlying technology for Web Service Description Language (WSDL), SOAP protocol and Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). It is highly probable that an attacker could inject malicious information into these XML files to modify the flow of the business process. Further, SOAP was not designed with security in mind, it is possible to tamper the SOAP messages while they are in transit. There exist a number of such potential vulnerabilities which lead to possible security breach in the individual services. In an orchestrated business process, there are possibilities of more vulnerabilities. One of the existing tools namely WS-Attacker is only capable of testing the security of individual web services alone. In spite of the widespread usage of SOA, currently there is limited automatic tool support for testing the security provided by an entire SOA application involving service orchestration.

We investigate the significance of quality attributes when designing service-based systems and how quality attributes are addressed through design decisions, across application domains, and related to other aspects of software development, e.g., architecture documentation. We conducted a descriptive survey. The survey was done as an online questionnaire targeting practitioners. Furthermore, we included researchers with practical design experience. We obtained 56 valid responses. Most survey participants consider quality attributes and functionality as equally important and treat quality attributes explicitly rather than implicitly. Furthermore, dependability is the most relevant quality attribute in service-based systems; we do not find quality attributes that are particularly important in specific application domains. Most quality attributes are addressed by ad hoc decisions, rather than established architecture or design patterns or technologies. Only few decision alternatives are considered when making architectural decisions to address quality attributes. Our results partially confirm anecdotal evidence from current literature, but also strengthen previous claims by providing empirical evidence.

This is the idea of this work, in which behavioural models created at design time are also used at runtime to evolve system behaviour. These behavioural models describe the routine tasks that users want to be automated by the system. However, users’ needs may change after system deployment, and the routine tasks automated by the system must evolve to adapt to these changes. To facilitate this evolution, the automation of the specified routine tasks is achieved by directly interpreting the models at runtime. This turns models into the primary means to understand and interact with the system behaviour associated with the routine tasks as well as to execute and modify it. Thus, we provide tools to allow the adaptation of this behaviour by modifying the models at runtime. This means that the system behaviour evolution is performed by using high-level abstractions and avoiding the costs and risks associated with shutting down and restarting the system.','Software & Systems Modeling',1,'Estefanía SerralPedro ValderasVicente Pelechano','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(408,'Personality assessment using multiple online social networks','2015','0',' Online social networks Personality Facebook LinkedIn','Abstract Personality plays an important role in various aspects of our daily life. It is being used in many application scenarios such as i) personalized marketing and advertisement of commercial products, ii) designing personalized ambient environments, iii) personalized avatars in virtual world, and iv) by psychologists to treat various mental and personality disorders. Traditional methods of personality assessment require a long questionnaire to be completed, which is time consuming. On the other hand, several works have been published that seek to acquire various personality traits by analyzing Internet usage statistics. Researchers have used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and various other websites to collect usage statistics. However, we are still far from a successful outcome. This paper uses a range of divergent features of Facebook and LinkedIn social networks, both separately and collectively, in order to achieve better results. In this work, the big five personality trait model is used to analyze the five traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The experimental results show that the accuracy of personality detection improves with the use of complementary features of multiple social networks (Facebook and LinkedIn, in our case) for openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. However, for extroversion we found that the use of only LinkedIn features provides better results than the use of only Facebook features or both Facebook and LinkedIn features.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',1,'Shally BhardwajPradeep K.

This paper provides an overview of SaaS including its architecture and major technical issues such as customization, multi-tenancy architecture, redundancy and recovery mechanisms, and scalability. Specifically, a SaaS system can have architecture relating to a database-oriented approach, middleware-oriented approach, service-oriented approach, or PaaS-oriented approach. Various SaaS customization strategies can be used from light customization with manual coding to heavy customization where the SaaS system and its underlying PaaS systems are customized together. Multi-tenancy architecture is an important feature of a SaaS and various trade-offs including security isolation, performance, and engineering effort need to be considered. It is important for a SaaS system to have multi-level redundancy and recovery mechanisms, and the SaaS system needs to coordinate these with the underlying PaaS system. Finally, SaaS scalability mechanisms include a multi-level architecture with load balancers, automated data migration, and software design strategies. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.','',1,'Tsai W.T., Bai X.Y., Huang Y.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(414,'Developing a Service Oriented IT Platform for Synchromodal Transportation','2014','0',' Service Oriented Architecture SOA Synchromodal IT platform Logistics Multimodal Transportation','Abstract Due to rapid global economic growth and competition, there is an increased pressure on logistic companies.

Better utilization of different modes of transport and improved decision making can contribute to solving both these challenges.

The rapidly evolving technology on the database field provides the opportunity to manage directly the semi-structured documents in line with the requirements of business processes. A continuum of possible document formats may exist in business environments. The documents can be categorized by the organization of the underlying data collections and according to the necessity and capability of data included in documents as whether wholly or partially is to be structured. The most modern database technology yields tools for handling and retrieving data making use of semi-structured and unstructured data. Our proposed approach (1) on one hand provides a theoretical framework for modeling IS to shape into some structure, (2) on the other hand yields guidance for design method to employ it for practical application with the extension of specific elementary models. The proposed modeling method that places the emphasis onto the documents and their symbiotic life with processes helps in understanding the behavior of most modern information systems. As a result, the combination of document-centric modeling and the enterprise architecture approach gives an opportunity for a unified modeling approach that keeps an eye on Conway’s thesis that states that software architecture congruent with the structure of development team, and this statement may be paraphrased that the overall document structure may reflect the structure of the specific organization.','Vietnam Journal of Computer Science',1,'Bálint MolnárAndrás Benczúr','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(421,'Restoring security of evolving software models using graph transformation','2015','2',' Evolution Graph transformation Model transformation Model-based software engineering security','Abstract Security certification of complex systems requires a high amount of effort. As a particular challenge, today’s systems are increasingly long-living and subject to continuous change. After each change of some part of the system, the whole system needs to be re-certified from scratch (since security properties are not in general modular), which is usually far too much effort. When models for software get changed, this can lead to security weaknesses that are also part of the software system that is derived from those models. Hence, it is important to check the models with respect to security properties and correct them respectively. To address this challenge, we present an approach which not only finds security weaknesses but can also correct them in a tool-supported way. As time goes by, a diverse number of changing requirements that may be security-related and non-security-related lead to an evolving system that met its security requirements at design time but can contain vulnerabilities with respect to meanwhile updated security knowledge. Supported by patterns we can describe and detect potential flaws that may arise in models, such as inconsistencies in security requirements. Potential violations can be formalized in the patterns as well as the correction alternatives to fix these. It is based on graph transformation and can be applied to different types of models and violations. For flaw detection, these patterns are used as the left-hand sides of graph transformation rules. Using graph transformation, we can further correct the models and establish that they no longer violate the security requirements under investigation. The approach is supported by a tool which can check whether these patterns arise in models and assist the user in correcting the security vulnerabilities.','International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer',2,'Jens BürgerJan JürjensSven Wenzel','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(422,'SOA in the CoNSIS coalition environment: Extending the WS-I Basic Profile for using SOA in a tactical environment','2012','','autarchy; fully distributed; NNEC; non-hierarchical; schema-based compression; SOAP-based security mechanisms','This article describes the elements necessary to allow SOA based CCIS systems to operate in a mobile tactical environment.

(2) The “teachable agent”—Elle—begins not with a tabula rasa but rather with an understanding of the domain content which is close to the human student’s. (3) Most importantly, Elle never actually learns anything directly from the human tutor! Instead, there is a super-agent (Cyc) which already knows the domain content extremely well. BELLA builds up a mental model of the human student by observing them interact with Elle. It uses that Socratically to decide what Elle’s current mental model should be (what concepts and skills Elle should already know, and what sorts of mistakes it should make) so as to best help the user to overcome their current confusions. All changes to the Elle model are made by BELLA, not by the user—the only learning going on is BELLA learning more about the user—but from the user’s point of view it often appears as though Elle were attending to them and learning from them.

Large scale agent in the sense number of agents is large with big data handling capability. In each grid site active optimized agents are presented for execute the job. Each agent has a unique ID and different role in grid computing network. In some situation agents are used to migrate the one supplier to another supplier easily that is work replacement carried out by multi agent. Overloaded agent\'s host is relocating the service to other agent\'s host named as agent migration. Little work and idle agents are waiting for upcoming job. For deploying the application via host, first predict the best agent from a lot of distributed active agents. Buyer or consumer asks the service request from the supplier or seller. In this pairing service, the multi agents are acting as bridge between Buyer and supplier. List of Intelligent based large scale multi agents are deployment agent, task agent, mobility agent, optimization agent, matchmaker agent, mobile agent, supplier agent, resource agent, application agent.

We address a specific alignment problem, namely, checking the compliance of a service-oriented architecture-representing a composite service-with security requirements. Service-oriented architectures are dynamic (services can be replaced on-the-fly), and assessing compliance with security requirements is key, since non-compliance may lead to sanctions as well as privacy violation.

However, the way networked computing is being used for business and social uses is undergoing rapid changes as new ways of constructing distributed execution environments from varieties of resources, ranging from computational, storage, network to application level services, provided by globally distributed service providers are emerging. In light of these developments, the paper examines what core concepts, components, and techniques that will be required in the next-generation middleware for dependable distributed computing.

In conjunction with context awareness and service delivery mechanisms, it is possible to dynamically deliver services to users by taking into account contextual information, e.g., user’s locations, devices’ states, current activities. However, implementing such systems in actual smart spaces is not trivial. The micro and macro context awareness model helps in defining layers on which contextual information are processed as close as possible from their sources (micro), without losing the benefits of information processing at a systemic level (macro). This paper describes the micro and macro context awareness model and its uses in the implementation of a service provision system for smart environments. Transparency and intelligibility are important factors in context awareness system, which help developers to fully understand the full behavior of the systems and help users to learn how the systems work. We therefore accompanied our micro and macro model with an intelligibility model which allow the generation of explanations describing the system’s behaviors according to the processed context.

In the case of multi-tenant systems this would mean dynamic creation of a tenant by integrating existing cloud-based services on the fly. Presently, dynamic creation of a tenant is handled by building the required components from scratch. Although multi-tenant systems help providers save cost by allocating multiple tenants to the same instance of an application, they incur huge reconfiguration costs. Cost and time spent on these reconfiguration activities can be reduced by re-constructing tenants from existing tenant configurations supported by service providers. Multi-tenant cloud-based systems also lack the facility of allowing clients to specify their requirements. Giving clients the flexibility to specify requirements helps them avoid spending an excessive amount of time and effort looking through a list of services, many of which might not be relevant to them. Moreover, dynamic provisioning in the cloud requires an integrated solution across the technology stack (software, platform and infrastructure) combining functional, non-functional and resource allocation requirements. Existing research works in the area of web service matching, although numerous, still fall short, since they usually consider each requirement type in isolation and cannot provide an integrated solution. To that end, in this paper we investigate the features needed for dynamic service provisioning on the cloud. We propose a novel User Interface-Tenant Selector-Customizer (UTC) model and approach, which enables cloud-based services to be systematically modeled and provisioned as variants of existing service tenants in the cloud. Our approach considers functional, non-functional and resource allocation requirements, which are explicitly specified by the client via the user interface component of the model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first such integrated approach. We illustrate our ideas using a realistic running example, and also present a proof-of-concept prototype built using IBM’s Rational Software Architect modeling tool. We also present experimental results demonstrating the applicability of our matching algorithm. Our results show significant reduction in matching time with the help of an elimination process that reduces the search space needed for performing matching.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Lakshmi RamachandranNanjangud C.

One of the principal causes of this high cost is the large amount of \"paperwork\" - the administrative expenses incurred for each medical procedure. While the debate continues about whether the country would be better off with a single-payer medical system or the current private insurance approach, there are a number of ways to reduce the administrative costs without excessive risk. These costs are essentially about getting information in the right form, to the right place, at the right time - a challenge that is by no means unique to the healthcare industry. This presentation identifies some of the approaches that have been successful in the manufacturing sector to make the sharing of information - interoperability - more efficient. Manufacturing technology has been developing and improving for decades. Principles like lean manufacturing, paperless design, ISO 9000 performance practices and Taguchi methods are a given for today\'s major manufacturers. With trends toward global manufacturing and outsourcing, practices have now evolved to Internetbased communication of engineering designs, inventory levels, purchase orders, and a wide variety of other logistical, financial and technical data. Supporting all this, a suite of standards has been developed, deployed, and winnowed down to some that really help, leaving others that seemed promising but failed to meet expectations by the wayside. So what can we learn from all those years of development, deployment, and trial and error? There are a few \"lowhanging fruit\" that the healthcare community can take advantage of to save years of expensive experimentation. Large, universal solutions tend to be difficult to implement. An expensive lesson that cannot be overemphasized is to avoid the temptation to design a comprehensive, universal solution \"from soup to nuts.\" Choose solutions that can be adopted in bite-size chunks, and ensure that those solutions are extensible. Take advantage of solutions that are already in use in the eCommerce/eBusiness sector. For example, the Open Application Group, Inc. (OAGi) is an open industry consortium that has defined a comprehensive set of \"Business Object Documents,\" or BODs, to exchange information about commercial orders, requests for bids, inventory levels, capacities, and much more. These are in use by auto makers, retailers, governments, and service providers in over 40 countries. As communication needs are being revisited in the healthcare sector, it makes sense to review the catalog of messages from OAGi to see which ones can be used \"out of the box\" and which might be adapted to this industry. As another example, the Object Management Group (OMG) has developed a language called BPMN to describe the flow of business processes and information in a neutral, open way. This allows business partners using a variety of commercial project management tools to integrate their respective procedures. This could be especially useful, given the flow of patients, goods, and information in a clinical environment. Finally, we should build the information exchange protocols on top of established communications layers, using middleware standards including Web Services (from W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium) and ebXML (from UN/CEFACT and OASIS). These international standards are supported by a wide selection of commercial tools that make the goal of seamlessly communicating with your business partners both more achievable and affordable. Build testing into your solution. Often, standards are developed without giving attention to the testing that is critical to a successfully deployed standards-based solution. Several types of testing are needed: validation testing to ensure the standard itself can meet the needs of the users and is of high quality; conformance testing to ensure that software applications meet all of, or a known portion of a standard; and interoperability testing to ensure that different implementations have compatible interpretations of the standard to the extent that meaningful information is transferred from one application to another. Standards that are developed with testing in mind are less expensive to test later on. Having poor interoperability is expensive. Studies at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) such as \"Economic Impact of Inadequate Infrastructure for Supply Chain Integration\" [2] have shown wasted expenses in the billions of dollars directly attributable to data exchange errors. Achieving interoperability is not easy. A NIST report, \"Concepts for Automating Systems Integration\" [3] identifies 23 different dimensions of interoperability problems, only one of which is syntactic conflict (which most people think of when integrating systems). We need to approach this problem with an appreciation of the degree of complexity it presents. Assume the world will always be heterogeneous. \"Integration\" is a process, not an end state (so we must pay attention to the process). It is important to make the integration process itself easy and fluid, because there will constantly be a need to re-integrate a distributed system as technology, tools, and requirements evolve. © 2009 IEEE.','',2,'Ray S.R.','scopus/bpmn security.csv','scopus','\0'),(445,'Where does model-driven engineering help?

This paper summarizes the experiences of three large industrial participants in a European research project with the objective of developing techniques and tools for applying MDE on the development of large and complex software systems. The participants had varying degrees of previous experience with MDE. They found MDE to be particularly useful for providing abstractions of complex systems at multiple levels or from different viewpoints, for the development of domain-specific models that facilitate communication with non-technical experts, for the purposes of simulation and testing, and for the consumption of models for analysis, such as performance-related decision support and system design improvements. From the industrial perspective, a methodology is considered to be useful and cost-efficient if it is possible to reuse solutions in multiple projects or products. However, developing reusable solutions required extra effort and sometimes had a negative impact on the performance of tools. While the companies identified several benefits of MDE, merging different tools with one another in a seamless development environment required several transformations, which increased the required implementation effort and complexity. Additionally, user-friendliness of tools and the provision of features for managing models of complex systems were identified as crucial for a wider industrial adoption of MDE.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Parastoo MohagheghiWasif GilaniAlin StefanescuMiguel A.

Due to the multiplicity and diversity of involved actors, volumes of data, and heterogeneity of shared information; crisis management systems tend to be highly vulnerable and subject to unforeseen incidents. As a result, the dependability of crisis management systems can be at risk. This paper presents a cloud-based resilient and trustworthy infrastructure (known as rDaaS) to quickly develop secure crisis management systems. The rDaaS integrates the Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) paradigm into a service-oriented architecture over cloud technology and provides a set of resilient DDDAS-As-A Service (rDaaS) components to build secure and trusted adaptable crisis processes. The rDaaS also ensures resilience and security by obfuscating the execution environment and applying Behavior Software Encryption and Moving Technique Defense.

The web service standards used for delivering the multimedia streaming objects is also not sufficient due to very large object size and also the processing and delivering continuous stream of large scale data is difficult and time consuming to variety of client devices. This paper describes about the Service Oriented Architecture, in using an efficient querying mechanism which is specified in an extension of WSDL using the multimedia content metadata and its descriptions for querying the best service. Transmission of streaming data requires a message exchange protocol (MEP) to be defined and then implement the MEP in their SOAP HTTP bindings of the web service. Processing the demand for non functional requirements such as efficiency and security in streaming increases and the performance of SOAP is impacted by XML processing and communication overheads. To overcome these we go for various compression schemes for SOAP messages, so that the transfer overhead is reduced. By the new querying mechanism the efficiency of finding services can be improved as irrelevant data can be eliminated and by creating the MEP, efficiency is increased in terms of resource consumption.','Intelligent Computing Applications (ICICA), 2014 International Conference on',1,'S.

Aspect-Oriented Business Process Modelling is an approach that aims at encapsulating these concerns in a model-oriented way. However, state-of-the-art techniques lack efficient mechanisms that allow for the specification of concerns in such a way that they can be executed in parallel to other parts of the process. Moreover, existing techniques exclusively focus on the formulation of mandatory concerns. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new approach to encapsulate both optional and mandatory concerns, which can be executed concurrently with other process functionalities. One core element of the new approach is that it extends current Aspect-Oriented Business Process Modelling approaches with declarative rules. Thus, this hybrid approach allows for a sophisticated management of cross-cutting concerns.','',2,'Amin JalaliFabrizio Maria MaggiHajo A.

Despite the projected benefits of an SDN, the abstractions toward the remote and centralized control tend to impose excessive control traffic overhead in order for the controller to acquire global network visibility as well as extend the legacy network’s inaccurate and unreliable management problems into the control plane. In addition, many recent SDNs facilitate multiple management pillars (such as customized interfaces and protocols) so that user applications can directly communicate to the data plane to measure and monitor specific information.

Among the concerns of ITSM, namely within the service level management process, are the requirements for services availability, performance, accuracy, capacity and security, which are specified in terms of service-level agreements (SLA). SLA definition and monitoring are open issues within the ITSM domain. This paper overviews an ongoing research initiative concerned with three specific problems in this context: (1) SLAs in the context of ITSM are informally specified in natural language; (2) SLAs specifications are not grounded on models of ITSM processes; (3) SLAs compliance verification in IT services is not performed at the same level of abstraction as service design. To mitigate those problems, we propose a model-based approach to IT services SLA specification and compliance verification. The specification part will be based on a SLA language - a domain specific language (DSL) for defining quality attributes as non functional requirements (NFRs) in the context of ITSM. Its metamodel will be an extension of the metamodel of the adopted process modeling language. As such, it will be possible to ground SLA definition on the corresponding IT service model constructs.

This situation has resulted partly from historical decisions in the original Internet design which emphasized decentralized network operations through colocated data and control planes on each network device. The situation for wireless networks is no different resulting in a lot of complexity and a plethora of largely incompatible wireless technologies. With traditional architectures providing limited support for programmability, there is a broad realization in the wireless community that future programmable wireless networks would require significant architectural innovations. In this paper, we will present an unified overview of the programmability solutions that have been proposed at the device and the network level. In particular, we will discuss software-defined radio (SDR), cognitive radio (CR), programmable MAC processor, and programmable routers as device-level programmability solutions, and software-defined networking (SDN), cognitive wireless networking (CWN), virtualizable wireless networking (VWN) and cloud-based wireless networking (CbWN) as network-level programmability solutions.

The sonification field attempts to address this issue by enlisting our auditory senses to detect anomalies or complex events that are difficult to detect via visualization alone. Storification attempts to improve analyst understanding by converting data streams into organized narratives describing the data at a higher level of abstraction than the input stream that they area derived from. While these techniques hold a great deal of promise, they also each have a unique set of challenges that must be overcome. Sonification techniques must represent a broad variety of distributed heterogeneous data and present it to the analyst/listener in a manner that doesn\'t require extended listening - as visual \"snapshots\" are useful but auditory sounds only exist over time. Storification still faces many human-computer interface (HCI) challenges as well as technical hurdles related to automatically generating a logical narrative from lower-level data streams. This paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes a service oriented architecture (SOA)-based hybrid visualization/ sonification/storification framework to enable distributed human-in-the-loop processing of data in a manner that makes optimized usage of both visual and auditory processing pathways while also leveraging the value of narrative explication of data streams. It addresses the benefits and shortcomings of each processing modality and discusses information infrastructure and data representation concerns required with their utilization in a distributed environment.

Unlike other system types, distributed systems - and especially distributed collaborative systems - can require custom, fine-grained authorization models and enforcement approaches that are able to take into account a range of semantic subtleties. In this paper we present a comprehensive, pattern-oriented software engineering approach to authorization for general distributed systems - with particular applicability to distributed collaborative systems - that allows developers to build custom, application-specific conceptual authorization models in a simple yet extensible manner, and to make informed decisions regarding their enforcement in software, as well as how their supporting rule/policy infrastructure should be designed. Our authorization approach is embodied in two instances of a new pattern-based security engineering construct called a security solution frame, which groups together related patterns - both security \"product\" and micro-process patterns - in different sub-structures, horizontally and vertically, for a single high-level security policy (in our case authorization and policy management). By applying specific micro-process patterns in each solution frame, developers are guided in using relevant \"product\" patterns to progressively construct a distributed authorization infrastructure - from abstract concepts toward concrete designs, via a number of levels of abstraction implying solution refinement and corresponding to stages of the development life-cycle. The summary-form \"product\" patterns encapsulated in each frame also help developers to form a holistic, \"global\" view when analyzing existing infrastructures. We illustrate and evaluate the proposal in the context of greenfield system development by applying our solution frames to design the authorization infrastructure of a (new) distributed system for secure file sharing and collaborative editing; and also use our solution frames to briefly analyze and capture the design decisions underlying two existing distributed authorization infrastructures: one based on UCON for collaborative Grid systems and another based on ZBAC for SOA-based systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequently, BPEL flows with the needed security are generated into AspectBPEL security aspects to be weaved in the aforementioned process. The main contributions of our approach are: (a) describing dynamic security policies using a standard language XACML, (b) generating automatically the AspectBPEL aspects of the XACML policies and (c) separating the business and security concerns of composite web services, hence developing and updating them separately at the BPEL side.

The chemical programming paradigm, which models applications as chemical solutions where molecules representing digital entities involved in the computation, react together to produce a result, has been recently shown to provide the needed abstractions for autonomic coordination of services. However, the execution of such programs over large scale platforms raises several problems hindering this paradigm to be actually leveraged. Among them, the atomic capture of molecules participating in concurrent reactions is one of the most significant. In this paper, we propose a protocol for the atomic capture of these molecules distributed and evolving over a large scale platform. As the density of possible reactions is crucial for the liveness and efficiency of such a capture, the protocol proposed is made up of two sub-protocols, each of them aimed at addressing different levels of densities of potential reactions in the solution. While the decision to choose one or the other is local to each node participating in a program’s execution, a global coherent behaviour is obtained. Proof of liveness, as well as intensive simulation results showing the efficiency and limited overhead of the protocol are given.','',1,'Marin BertierMarko ObrovacCédric Tedeschi','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(475,'Exploring the ambient assisted living domain: a systematic review','2016','0',' Ambient assisted living Active assisted living AAL Systematic literature review Assistive technologies Assistive needs Elderly','Abstract Ambient assisted living (AAL) is focused on providing assistance to people primarily in their natural environment.

Although these properties provide flexibility and scalability in handling data, security issues should be handled especially when mobile devices try to access data stored in cloud storage. Currently, a typical cloud storage service, Dropbox, offers server-side data encryption for security purpose. However, we think such method is not secure enough because all the encryption keys are managed by software and there is no attestation on the client software integrity. Moreover, a simple user identification based on user ID and Password is also easy to be compromised. Data sharing which is critical in enterprise environment is significantly restricted because it is not easy to share encryption key among users. In this paper, we propose DFCloud, a secure data access control method of cloud storage services to handle these problems found in the typical cloud storage service Dropbox. DFCloud relies on Trusted Platform Module (TPM) [1] to manage all the encryption keys and define a key sharing protocol among legal users. We assume that each client is mobile device using ARM TrustZone [2] technology. The DFCloud server prototype is implemented using ARM Fastmodel 7.1 and Open Virtualization software stack for ARM TrustZone.

In the proposed systems-theoretic view, a complex system is organized hierarchically from horizontal and vertical aggregations of components, but more important is the explicit control at each level of the hierarchy. Control actions are then determined by controllers that enforce constraints imposed on components and their interaction, and thus reduce their degree of autonomy. Not only the system behavior is restrained but nonfunctional properties emerge at each level. The finer the exercised control, the richer emergent properties should be. Therefore, achieving nonfunctional properties, such as liveness, predictability, safety and security, corresponds to solving control problems. The supervisory control theory initiated in the early and mid eighties is a mathematical apparatus that helps to accomplish this task in a rigorous way.','',2,'Daniel CôtéMichel Embe JiagueRichard St-Denis','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(489,'Value-centric design of the internet-of-things solution for food supply chain: Value creation, sensor portfolio and information fusion','2015','13',' Internet-of-things (IoT) Food supply chain Value-centric design Sensor portfolio Information fusion Industrial information integration engineering (IIIE)','Abstract The revolution of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is reshaping the modern food supply chains with promising business prospects.

Using the well-known classic two-state bounded set technique, we developed a service-oriented model that dynamically calculates the reliability of composite web services with rollback recovery (Mansour and Dillon in IEEE Trans Serv Comput 4(4), 2011 ). In order to improve the Quality of Service, fault tolerance techniques have been introduced using recovery block adaptation. Our workflow was based on series-parallel structures that constitute parts of existing structures. It is worth mentioning that major service-oriented systems contain larger and more complex structures than the simple series and parallel ones. This is a limitation in our previous approach. In order to consider more realistic service-oriented systems, other main structures, such as AND, XOR and Loop, should be included into our model. In this article, our previous structures are generalized to include AND, XOR and Loops. In addition to generalized structures, we extended the existing two-state bounded set technique to include three-state systems. This extension was especially motivated by XOR-based structures. A comparative study between bounded set techniques and a new stochastic model is also presented. Our simulation results accurately reflect the performance of the new proposed model and confirm our theoretical studies.

The proposed framework includes modules that incorporate the notion of monetary cost in current data management, but also modules that take optimization decisions for future data management taking into account both monetary cost and performance. The framework dictates the design of a middleware application that can be plugged on top of a cloud data management system. Such a middleware receives the user’s workload and preferences for cost and query performance and controls data management so that the user is satisfied and the cloud provider is viable and, furthermore, profitable.

One recent evolutionary step is SOA. The SOA model is perfectly engendered in Web services, which provide software platforms for building applications as services. Web services utilize supportive capabilities such as security, reliability, and monitoring. These capabilities are typically provisioned as handlers, which incrementally add new features. Even though handlers are very important, the method of utilization is crucial for obtaining potential benefits. Every attempt to support a service with an additional handler increases the chance of an overwhelmingly crowded handler chain. Moreover, a handler may become a bottleneck because of its comparably higher processing time. In this paper, we present the Distributed Handler Architecture to provide an efficient, scalable, and modular architecture. The performance and scalability benchmarks show that the distributed and parallel handler executions are very promising for suitable handler configurations.

To achieve the task’s execution, it has to be resolved in concrete components, which involves automatic matching and selection of components across various devices. Moreover, user tasks in pervasive environments are challenged by the dynamism of their execution environments. Thus, there is a need to adapt them for a continuous execution. Towards these challenges, we propose in this article a middleware that allows for each service of a user task, the best selection of the device and component used for its execution. The task resolution approach considers in addition to the functional aspects of the task, the user preferences, devices capabilities, services requirements and components preferences. The middleware also carries out adaptation of user’s tasks to cope with the dynamicity of pervasive environments. The adaptation consists of a partial reselection of devices and components that are affected by the changes. For this purpose, the middleware uses monitoring mechanisms to detect the changes during the execution of the user tasks.','Evolving Systems',1,'Imen Ben LahmarDjamel BelaïdHamid Mukhtar','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(515,'Ubiquity and QoS for cloud security','2012','','Architecture Model; Cloud Computing; Cloud Security; QoS; Ubiquity','Cloud computing brings many advantages in terms of externalization, service delivery, elasticity, dependability and scalability.

We propose a runtime monitor that can enforce the secrecy of freely chosen subtrees of the data throughout the execution. The key idea is to apply a generalized constant propagation for computing the public effect of branching constructs whose conditions may depend on the secret. This allows for a better precision than runtime monitors which rely on tainting of variables or nodes alone.

Multi-tenancy, the sharing of application instances and their underlying resources between users from different organizational domains, allows service providers to maximize resource utilization and reduce servicing costs per user. Realizing application multi-tenancy however requires suitable enabling mechanisms offered by their supporting middleware. Furthermore, the middleware itself can be multi-tenant in a similar fashion. In this work we focus on enabling multi-tenancy for one of the most important components in service-oriented middleware, the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). In particular, we discuss the prototype realization of a multi-tenant aware ESB, using an open source solution as the basis. We then evaluate the performance of our proposed solution by an ESB-specific benchmark that we extended for multi-tenancy purposes.','',1,'Steve StrauchVasilios AndrikopoulosSantiago Gómez SáezFrank Leymann','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(522,'c-Eclipse: An Open-Source Management Framework for Cloud Applications','2014','3','','Abstract Cloud application portability and optimal resource allocation are of great importance in the realm of Cloud infrastructure provisioning. c-Eclipse is an open-source Cloud Application Management Framework through which users are able to define the description, deployment and management phases of their Cloud applications in a clean and intuitive graphical manner.

In our approach, topic models are used as efficient dimension reduction techniques, which are able to capture semantic relationships between word-topic and topic-service interpreted in terms of probability distributions. To address the limitation of keywords-based queries, we represent web service description as a vector space and we introduce a new approach for discovering web services using latent factors. In our experiment, we compared the accuracy of the three probabilistic clustering algorithms (PLSA, LDA and CTM) with that of a classical clustering algorithm.

These components with web service interfaces may be available in-house, or may be supplied or hosted by external vendors. The use of multiple services, possibly utilizing different technologies, providers, locations, and sources, has implications for the end-to-end reliability of these applications to support a business process. Selecting the best service for individual tasks in a business process does not guarantee the most effective overall solution, particularly if criteria other than functional characteristics are employed. This paper examines reliability issues associated with applications developed within service oriented architecture. It develops a measure for deriving end-to-end application reliability, and develops a model to help select appropriate services for tasks in the business process which accommodate the redundant and overlapping functionality of available services and planned redundancy in task support to satisfy the reliability requirement of the resulting application. A genetic algorithm approach is adopted to select promising services to assemble the application using end-to-end reliability as the criterion of interest.

To meet these demands a variety of mechanisms has been developed to prevent errors at the structural level (e.g., deadlocks). In many application domains, however, processes often have to comply with business level rules and policies (i.e., semantic constraints ) as well. Hence, to ensure error-free executions at the semantic level, PrMS need certain control mechanisms for validating and ensuring the compliance with semantic constraints. In this paper, we discuss fundamental requirements for a comprehensive support of semantic constraints in PrMS. Moreover, we provide a survey on existing approaches and discuss to what extent they are able to meet the requirements and which challenges still have to be tackled. In order to tackle the particular challenge of providing integrated compliance support over the process lifecycle, we introduce the SeaFlows framework. The framework introduces a behavioural level view on processes which serves a conceptual process representation for constraint specification approaches. Further, it provides general compliance criteria for static compliance validation but also for dealing with process changes. Altogether, the SeaFlows framework can serve as formal basis for realizing integrated support of semantic constraints in PrMS.','Information Systems Frontiers',2,'Linh Thao LyStefanie Rinderle-MaKevin GöserPeter Dadam','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(560,'Model Checking of Security-Critical Applications in a Model-Driven Approach','2013','2','','Abstract This paper illustrates the integration of model checking in SecureMDD, a model-driven approach for the development of security-critical applications.

Current compliance checking approaches neglect such information as it is not readily available in process models. Even if ACs are automatically analysed with audit software, the results still need to be linked to related processes. By now, this linking is not methodically supported. To address this gap this paper presents a method to automatically enrich process models with audit relevant information about ACs. The method consists of three phases: process model construction, automated analysis of ACs, and model enrichment. It utilizes two existing artefacts and combines them to provide a comprehensive basis for compliance checking. Moreover, the enriched process models can support auditors in conducting process audits in ERP environments.','',2,'Martin Schultz','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(565,'Native structure-based modeling and simulation of biomolecular systems per mouse click','2014','1',' Protein folding RNA folding Native structure-based model Molecular dynamics GridBeans','Abstract Background Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide valuable insight into biomolecular systems at the atomic level. Notwithstanding the ever-increasing power of high performance computers current MD simulations face several challenges: the fastest atomic movements require time steps of a few femtoseconds which are small compared to biomolecular relevant timescales of milliseconds or even seconds for large conformational motions. At the same time, scalability to a large number of cores is limited mostly due to long-range interactions. An appealing alternative to atomic-level simulations is coarse-graining the resolution of the system or reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian to improve sampling while decreasing computational costs. Native structure-based models, also called Gō-type models, are based on energy landscape theory and the principle of minimal frustration. They have been tremendously successful in explaining fundamental questions of, e.g., protein folding, RNA folding or protein function. At the same time, they are computationally sufficiently inexpensive to run complex simulations on smaller computing systems or even commodity hardware. Still, their setup and evaluation is quite complex even though sophisticated software packages support their realization. Results Here, we establish an efficient infrastructure for native structure-based models to support the community and enable high-throughput simulations on remote computing resources via GridBeans and UNICORE middleware. This infrastructure organizes the setup of such simulations resulting in increased comparability of simulation results. At the same time, complete workflows for advanced simulation protocols can be established and managed on remote resources by a graphical interface which increases reusability of protocols and additionally lowers the entry barrier into such simulations for, e.g., experimental scientists who want to compare their results against simulations. We demonstrate the power of this approach by illustrating it for protein folding simulations for a range of proteins. Conclusions We present software enhancing the entire workflow for native structure-based simulations including exception-handling and evaluations. Extending the capability and improving the accessibility of existing simulation packages the software goes beyond the state of the art in the domain of biomolecular simulations. Thus we expect that it will stimulate more individuals from the community to employ more confidently modeling in their research.','BMC Bioinformatics',1,'Benjamin LutzClaude SinnerStefan BozicIvan KondovAlexander Schug','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(566,'Enhancing Service-Oriented Computing with Software Mobility','2012','0','','Abstract Service-oriented computing has emerged as a consensually accepted paradigm for the implementation and integration of distributed systems in heterogeneous environments.

However, what is for sure is that, it is a way of leveraging less expensive services based environment providing cost-effective solutions to various organizations to cater for their computing needs, without investing in computing infrastructure. However, cloud computing, just like other formats of computing, is not free from issues. One of the major barriers in adoption of cloud is security. Once migrated to cloud, you do not know where your data is physically stored, what laws and regulations govern the same and most important of all, who has access to it. This paper explores security issues related to cloud computing and proposes a paradigm for securing cloud. The paper investigates some of the key research challenges of implementing cloud-aware security solutions which can plausibly secure the ever-changing and dynamic cloud environment, followed by conclusion where we try to entail the whole research and try to formulate a practical security paradigm, which will enable the cloud providers and consumers to ensure that their data and valuable assets are safe from otherwise prying eyes.','Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks (CICSyN), 2012 Fourth International Conference on',1,'A.

The European FP7 project: “Energy Demand Aware Open Services for Smart Grid Intelligent Automation” is contributing to this research by providing an intelligent infrastructure for service deployment for the smart grid. The project defines a system architecture that provides interoperability between wireless sensors in home area networks connected over the Internet to a service provider function deployed in a cloud infrastructure. A key component in this infrastructure is the Home Energy Controlling Hub that, on the one hand, provides a platform for monitoring and aggregation of electricity consumption data from devices and appliances and, on the other hand, is the link between the deployed intelligent automation services and the home. To ensure openness and simplicity, the proposed infrastructure is based on the representational state transfer style architecture. This is adopted by implementing the emerging ZigBee IP and Smart Energy Profile 2.0 standards that to a wide extend conform with the Internet Protocol suite and state-of-the art web services development.','Wireless Personal Communications',1,'Rune Hylsberg JacobsenSøren Aagaard Mikkelsen','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(588,'Security measurement in service-based computing systems','2012','0','divergence;equivalence;information;measurement;relations;security','We propose a method for quantitative security analysis of service-based computing systems based on probabilistic and information theoretical approaches.

Approaches in Service-Oriented Architectures are allowing new ways for users and developers to manage, control and benefit from the services that are being made available. However, this also introduces new threats for service ecosystems and with wider deployment comes a greater need to identify and tackle threats before they become attacks. In this paper we introduce a new Threat Monitoring approach based on filtering and pattern-detection of a variety of event types. The approach enables threat monitoring across multiple composite services with a capability to integrate dynamic changes from various subsystems and offers high flexibility through the use of CEP (Complex Event Processing). Appropriate events are identified in the context of Service-Oriented Architectures and the Threat Monitoring Module described and implemented as part of the Aniketos platform. This module is able to pull threat descriptions from a repository and apply appropriate detection techniques at run-time in order to identify potential problems. The approach is novel in both its flexibility and applicability. Threats can be chosen by service developers from a community-managed repository and the process extends to both the identification and prediction of threats. The solution is evaluated through a future telecommunication services case study. © 2013 IEEE.','',1,'Ayed D., Asim M., Llewellyn-Jones D.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(591,'Systems and Virtualization Management : Standards and the Cloud (A report on SVM 2012)','2013','1',' Cloud CIM Web services and SOA Network Server Desktop management','Abstract Hosted by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) and collocated with the International Conference on Network and Service Management, SVM 2012 was the sixth International DMTF Academic Alliance Workshop on Systems and Virtualization Management.

However, systems based on these architectures (called SOA systems) evolve rapidly due to the addition of new functionalities, the modification of execution contexts and the integration of legacy systems. This evolution may hinder the maintenance of these systems, and thus increase the cost of their development. To ease the evolution and maintenance of SOA systems, they should satisfy good design quality criteria, possibly expressed using patterns. By patterns , we mean good practices to solve known and common problems when designing software systems. The goal of this study is to detect patterns in SOA systems to assess their design and their Quality of Service (QoS). We propose a three steps approach called SODOP (Service Oriented Detection Of Patterns), which is based on our previous work for the detection of antipatterns. As a first step, we define five SOA patterns extracted from the literature. We specify these patterns using “rule cards”, which are sets of rules that combine various metrics, static or dynamic, using a formal grammar. The second step consists in generating automatically detection algorithms from rule cards. The last step consists in applying concretely these algorithms to detect patterns on SOA systems at runtime. We validate SODOP on two SOA systems: Home-Automation and FraSCAti that contain respectively 13 and 91 services. This validation demonstrates that our proposed approach is precise and efficient.','',1,'Anthony DemangeNaouel MohaGuy Tremblay','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(594,'Foundations and Tools for End-User Architecting','2012','1',' end-user architecture end-user architecting software architecture end-user programming software composition software development tools','Abstract Within an increasing number of domains an important emerging need is the ability for technically naïve users to compose computational elements into novel configurations. Examples include astronomers who create new analysis pipelines to process telescopic data, intelligence analysts who must process diverse sources of unstructured text to discover socio-technical trends, and medical researchers who have to process brain image data in new ways to understand disease pathways. Creating such compositions today typically requires low-level technical expertise, limiting the use of computational methods and increasing the cost of using them. In this paper we describe an approach — which we term end-user architecting — that exploits the similarity between such compositional activities and those of software architects. Drawing on the rich heritage of software architecture languages, methods, and tools, we show how those techniques can be adapted to support end users in composing rich computational systems through domain-specific compositional paradigms and component repositories, without requiring that they have knowledge of the low-level implementation details of the components or the compositional infrastructure. Further, we outline a set of open research challenges that the area of end-user architecting raises.','',2,'David GarlanVishal DwivediIvan RuchkinBradley Schmerl','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(595,'A Survey of Requirement Engineering Interactions in Telecommunication Systems','2012','0','3rd Party Componenets;Context Aware Requirements;Distibuted Systems;Goal Oriented;Incremental Requirements;Requirement Engineering;Requirement Tools;Requirements Interaction Management;Security;Service Oriented;Standard;Survey;Telecommunication','Summary form only given. Telecommunication systems are large, distributed, complex, heterogeneous and evolving systems that involve software and hardware components. These traits present a challenge from Requirement Engineering perspective. Telecommunication systems can be abstracted to having infrastructure layer that delivers services and consumer layer where end user devices use these services. As processing power of the telecommunication consumer devices gain more power and demand more bandwidth, it becomes more pervasive, gain importance and the end users will have greater dependencies on it. Telecommunication infrastructure technologies are also evolving on fast pace to deliver to customer needs and level of service expected. A fierce competition exists between new entrants and more established companies to deliver the telecommunication system with the features and constraints at competitive pricing and aggressive scheduling by using new technologies. Within the above facets, there are many stakeholders with conflicting and complex requirements. In many cases, the situation of conflicting requirements is complicated further by the interaction with existing systems. That can create large, complex, and conflicting requirements. This needs more than ad hoc approach to achieve consensus within the constraints of the systems. Requirement Engineering (RE) is the field that addresses these issues and provides paradigms, methodologies, and tools to resolve these issues. All these factors highlight the need for requirement engineering to assist new and evolving telecommunication systems to deliver the desired requirements with shortest period of time, lowest budget and cause the least amount of disruption for current users. There are multiple aspects of requirement engineering in telecommunications like paradigms, methodologies, tools, inter-dependencies and interactions. Since Requirement Engineering is a general field, this paper will focus on telecommunication indu- try current use and interaction with the Requirement Engineering field. This paper surveys the current landscape of telecommunication industry interaction with Requirement Engineering. The aspects of change, complexity, internal and external components present a challenge in requirement engineering to capture and present early stable requirements within known, unknown limitations and accommodation for future needs. Multiple approaches, frameworks, tools and solutions on Requirement Engineering in the telecommunication industry are explored in this paper.

Consequently, this paper embraces a systematic literature review to classify and analyze SOSE Challenges claimed in research communities from January 2009 to October 2014. First, the search string was applied to each selected database and the title, abstract and keywords of the potentially relevant primary studies were examined where 693 primary studies were found relevant. Then, the full texts of the 693 relevant studies were critically reviewed. As a result, 91 primary studies with 122 claimed SOSE challenges were identified and recorded. The results revealed quality of service (QOS) as the major SOSE Challenge, it is responsible for about 45% of the total SOSE challenges claimed for the period under review. Further investigation revealed Security as the main attribute responsible for placing QOS as the major SOSE challenge. It is recommended that research effort is required to improve the security of SOA applications. In addition, other areas that require research effort are Service provision and integration. © 2015 SERSC.','',1,'Ahmed M.M., Letchmunan S.','scopus/soa security.csv','scopus',''),(597,'Service replication taxonomy in distributed environments','2016','0',' Service replication Service-oriented architecture Distributed environments Replication process Quality of service','Abstract Abstract Nowadays, most modern distributed environments, including service-oriented architecture (SOA), cloud computing, and mobile computing, support replication technologies in order to improve operational characteristics of the services provided.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of replication challenges, types, techniques, and algorithms in distributed environments such as SOA, cloud, and mobile. Moreover, the role of replication in enhancing several QoS attributes, including performance, availability, security, scalability, and reliability, is examined.

An example of a simple air traffic control system is introduced, and the discrepancies that can arise when read-only operations examine the state at atomic and finegrained levels are handled by retrenchment. Non-ACID timing aspects of the ATC example are also handled by retrenchment, and the treatment is generalised to yield the Retrenchment Atomicity Pattern . The utility of the pattern is confirmed against a number of different case studies. One is the Mondex Electronic Purse, its protocol treated as a conventional atomic transaction. Another is the recovery protocol of Mondex, viewed as a compensated transaction (leading to the view that compensated transactions in general fit the pattern). A final one comprises various unruly phenomena occurring in the implementations of software transactional memory systems, which can frequently display non-ACID behaviour. In all cases the Atomicity Pattern is seen to perform well.','Formal Aspects of Computing',2,'Richard BanachCzesław JeskeAnthony HallSusan Stepney','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(600,'Service-Oriented DDoS Detection Mechanism Using Pseudo State in a Flow Router','2013','0','','As distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have caused serious economic and social problems.

However, SoAs make use of verbose networking technologies and require reliable and relatively high bandwidth communications. Tactical scenarios normally cannot rely on such infrastructure and events like natural disasters can severely damage the network infrastructure in rural and urban environments.

Developers often compose source code identifiers with abbreviated words and acronyms, and do not always use consistent mechanisms and explicit separators when creating identifiers. Such choices and inconsistencies impede the work of developers that must understand identifiers by decomposing them into their component terms, and mapping them onto dictionary, application or domain words. When software documentation is scarce, outdated or simply not available, developers must therefore use the available contextual information to understand the source code. This paper aims at investigating how developers split and expand source code identifiers, and, specifically, the extent to which different kinds of contextual information could support such a task. In particular, we consider (i) an internal context consisting of the content of functions and source code files in which the identifiers are located, and (ii) an external context involving external documentation. We conducted a family of two experiments with 63 participants, including bachelor, master, Ph.D. students, and post-docs. We randomly sampled a set of 50 identifiers from a corpus of open source C programs and we asked participants to split and expand them with the availability (or not) of internal and external contexts. We report evidence on the usefulness of contextual information for identifier splitting and acronym/abbreviation expansion. We observe that the source code files are more helpful than just looking at function source code, and that the application-level contextual information does not help any further. The availability of external sources of information only helps in some circumstances. Also, in some cases, we observe that participants better expanded acronyms than abbreviations, although in most cases both exhibit the same level of accuracy. Finally, results indicated that the knowledge of English plays a significant effect in identifier splitting/expansion. The obtained results confirm the conjecture that contextual information is useful in program comprehension, including when developers split and expand identifiers to understand them. We hypothesize that the integration of identifier splitting and expansion tools with IDE could help to improve developers’ productivity.','Empirical Software Engineering',1,'Latifa GuerroujMassimiliano Di PentaYann-Gaël GuéhéneucGiuliano Antoniol','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(613,'Overview of secured web services specifications','2013','1','SOA(Service Oriented Article); SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol); Web-Service; WS-Federation; WS-Security; WS-Trust; XML','The proliferation of XML based web services in the IT industry not only gives rise to opportunities but challenges too, Namely the challenges of security and a standard way of maintaining it across domains and organisational boundaries, OASIS, W3C and other organisations have done some great work in bringing about this synergy.

This is particularly evident in industrial surveillance applications, due to the huge amount of data needed to be stored, delivered and handled. In this paper, we address both issues by incorporating (a) computer vision tools that allows efficient tracking of salient visual objects for long time regardless of the dynamics of the visual environment –via a self initialized tracking algorithm—and (b) an adaptive optimal rate distortion scheme able to allocate different priorities for each detected video object with respect to users’ needs, network platforms capabilities and terminal characteristics. The self initialized tracker firstly appropriately describes visual content, secondly incorporates adaptive mechanisms for automatically update the tracker to adjust to the current conditions and thirdly includes an efficient decision mechanism that estimates the time instances in which adaptation should be activated. For the rate distortion algorithm, an optimal adaptive framework is adopted which is capable of allocating the desired quality to objects of users’ interest without violating the target bit rate of the sequence. The Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is adopted towards this purpose. The advantage of the WPT is that it localizes the frequency components of each video object and therefore it offers additionally content adaptability according to video object texture coding. The WPT tree is transmitted only at the first frame of each shot and thus dew bits are required for its encoding. Experimental results and comparisons with other approaches are presented to illustrate the good performance of the proposed architecture.

Therefore, it is increasingly important to efficiently and effectively manage the adaptation of such service compositions while guaranteeing quality attributes, such as availability, performance or cost. Within this context, software metrics to quantify the adaptability of a business process in orchestrating distributed services are highly demanded in conjunction with techniques for evaluating other system quality attributes. This paper proposes a set of software metrics to quantify the adaptability of a service-oriented application when services are composed dynamically trough a business process.

The WS-* standards define how middleware aspects (security, reliability, transactions, etc.) can be realized through web services. Although the WS-Policy standard family can be used to configure the various WS-* protocols, they are very hard to construct and to maintain manually. In addition, most SOA products and Grid systems implementing these standards provide their own methods for configuring these protocols, making it very difficult to match the various configuration options of different products. This fact inspired us to propose a platform independent metamodel for describing distributed systems of web services including the most important WS-* standards. The present article defines the full metamodel, it specifies the corresponding programming language formally, and it shows the productivity of the framework built around the metamodel through real-life examples. The framework is capable of generating product specific configuration files and source codes, resulting in directly interoperable applications even between different SOA products.

After decades of streamlining terminal operations, ports still experience process and coordination problems due to a lack of information exchange and decision support. To improve the overall efficiency and quality of port operations, innovative information systems for gathering and processing operational data based on identification, sensing and mobile technologies are required to enhance the visibility of operations in information systems. A port-centric information system also requires the integration of external systems, such as traffic control systems, to further consider external factors. In this paper, we present a cloud-based system architecture for the real-time collection, management, and utilization of operational data with a particular focus on inter-terminal transportation. The proposed system architecture is based on widely adopted standards and utilizes the cost-effectiveness and scalability of a cloud computing infrastructure for processing large amounts of operational data. The information system lowers the bounded rationality of actors providing information and decision support as a service to the port community and other stakeholders. As such, this paper is intended to provide a conceptual view on a system for enhancing the management of real-time data to better manage traffic flows and transport modes, enhance the coordination between intra-terminal and inter-terminal/landside operations, and reduce empty handling processes.','',2,'Leonard HeiligStefan Voß','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(623,'QoE loss score value for service migration in context aware environment','2014','0','','The increasing amount of smart devices and handheld devices have widened the amount of information presence all over.

However, there have been some initiatives to address the authorization-bypass security vulnerability in WS-BPEL through integration with access control models such as RBAC. However, the RBAC models used lack expressiveness in role definitions and in roles to permissions mappings.

At the same time, the development of web service and cloud technology, is providing a potential platform to support these activities. The problem on which we focus is the technical hurdles for users without detailed knowledge of such mechanisms – in a word, ‘accessibility’ – specifically: (i) the heavy weight and diversity of infrastructures that inhibits shareability and collaboration between services, (ii) the relatively complicated processes associated with deployment and management of web services for non-disciplinary specialists, and (iii) the relative technical difficulty in packaging the legacy software that encapsulates key discipline knowledge for web-service environments.

However, security and trustworthiness concerns constitute an obstacle for uptake, as trust relations that were in place in traditional component acquisition and operation phases cannot be established in the same forms due to the high number of service providers available and shorter time-to-market requirements. This paper presents our view about how security certification could address these issues, going beyond existing schemes, which mostly address static systems and environments.

The criticality is more pronounced when the service provider handles the non-functional QoS attribute of privacy, i.e., privacy related to the customer’s personal data. In this regard, the customer needs some guarantee(s) from the service provider about confidentiality management, leading to overall quality characterization of the provided service. A service level agreement (SLA) is primarily intended to specify (in terms of clauses) the level of such non-functional QoS delivered to the customer. The aim is to provide customers with tools that show the fulfillment of QoS guarantees, through SLA monitoring process. In this paper, we address the problem of usage control of private data in service based applications ensuring end-to-end QoS capabilities. We propose a query containment based approach to support the monitoring of privacy-aware SLA compliance, that spells out a customer’s privacy rights, and shows how the customer’s private information must be handled by a Web service provider. We introduce the private data usage flow model upon which the monitoring is performed to observe the data usage flow, and capture the privacy vulnerabilities that may lead to non-compliance. The model is built on top of (i) properties and time-related privacy requirements to be monitored, and (ii) a set of identified privacy violations.

This is particularly important when dealing with stateful services (such as Windows Workflows or WS-BPEL processes) where any mismatch in the sequence of messages might lead the orchestration to a deadlock situation.

At the same time, it can be among the most challenging kinds of capability for cloud service brokers to realise. In this paper we focus on two specific themes within this scope. We present a motivating scenario and outline key research challenges associated with introducing policy-driven governance and service level failure mitigation capabilities in brokers.','',2,'Konstantinos BratanisDimitrios Kourtesis','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(642,'Model checking Petri nets with names using data-centric dynamic systems','2016','0',' Formal verification Petri nets with names Infinite-state systems First-order temporal logics Data-aware business processes Resource-aware business processes','Abstract Petri nets with name creation and management ( \\({\\nu}\\) -PNs) have been recently introduced as an expressive model for dynamic (distributed) systems, whose dynamics are determined not only by how tokens flow in the system, but also by the pure names they carry. On the one hand, this extension makes the resulting nets strictly more expressive than P/T nets: they can be exploited to capture a plethora of interesting systems, such as distributed systems enriched with channels and name passing, service interaction with correlation mechanisms, and resource-constrained workflow nets that explicitly account for process instances. On the other hand, fundamental properties like coverability, termination and boundedness are decidable for \\({\\nu}\\) -PNs. In this work, we go one step beyond the verification of such general properties, and provide decidability and undecidability results of model checking \\({\\nu}\\) -PNs against variants of first-order \\({\\mu}\\) -calculus, recently proposed in the area of data-aware process analysis. While this model checking problem is undecidable in the general case, decidability can be obtained by considering different forms of boundedness, which still give raise to an infinite-state transition system. We then ground our framework to tackle the problem of soundness checking over workflow nets enriched with explicit process instances and resources. Notably, our decidability results are obtained via a translation to data-centric dynamic systems, a recently devised framework for the formal specification and verification of data-aware business processes working over full-fledged relational databases with constraints. In this light, our results contribute to the cross-fertilization between the area of formal methods for concurrent systems and that of foundations of data-aware processes, which has not been extensively investigated so far.','Formal Aspects of Computing',1,'Marco MontaliAndrey Rivkin','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(643,'Livelock and Deadlock Detection for PA Inter-organizational Business Processes','2012','0','','Abstract The Public Administration domain is characterized by the dominance of inter-organizational Business Processes. These are a set of interrelated and sequential activities shared and executed by two or more Public Administration officies to achieve a business objective that is of value to citizens or companies in term of services. A Business Process results from the un-trivial integration of internal administration processes, so that structural problems such as livelock or deadlock may easily occur and in reality they are generally solved by involved civil servants. Nevertheless with the shift versus an electronic government this problem becomes particularly relevant. The paper presents a suitable approach for inter-organizational Business Process detection of livelock and deadlock situations. In particular, we introduce an approach to directly verify a Business Process modeled using the BPMN 2.0 semi-formal notation. The verification uses a state evaluation technique with an optimized unfolding algorithm considering specific BPMN 2.0 characteristics. A plug-in for the Eclipse platform has been also developed, which permits to have an integrated environment in which to design Business Process, using the Eclipse BPMN 2.0 Modeler, and to automatically verify it.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach wherein SMB enterprises would exchange secured business information to a B2B cloud service hosted outside of the enterprise. This service offers key B2B protocol capabilities and features such as packaging, security and partner on-boarding. In a typical document exchange flow, the SMB enterprise would send it\'s business information to this B2B cloud service which then packages it using the agreed upon B2B protocol and makes it available to the intended recipient enterprise.

Whenever an error in a packet is detected, the packet should be retransmitted back to the receiver to reduce/overcome the data loss. Automatic repeat request (ARQ) method is a well-known data retransmission method used by protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This method will retransmit data all the way from the sender resulting higher end-to-end retransmission delays in the packet transmission. Nevertheless this method is widely used and operational, it will also introduce unnecessarily duplicate packets further congesting the networks when it retransmit the entire packet stream from an unacknowledged packet after detecting a retransmission requirement. Encryption and public key cryptography are important technologies that are used to preserve data security and integrity, and to reduce information theft on the public networks. These existing technologies have less flexibility over the current security requirements and the conventional routers are unable to provide end services to the users and applications. To address this need, our laboratory introduced the per-hop data encryption protocol for service-oriented router (SoR) based public networks which allows more secured and flexible method to transfer data over public networks [15]. SoRs are introduced to maintain rich information for the next-generation networks by shifting the current Internet infrastructure to an information-based and an open-innovation platform [6]. SoR is a middleware and can be implemented on a Cisco AXP and Juniper JunosV App Engine where it can analyse all packet stream transactions on its interfaces. Using the features of the SoR, in this paper, we propose a previous hop data retransmission service for public networks. This proposing service can provide higher data availability and reliability to the data that traverses through public network- , reducing the end-to-end data retransmission delays. We implemented a prototype of previous hop data retransmission service on the ns-3 simulator. Furthermore, from the evaluations on the test bed topology, it clearly showed that the proposed method was 80.43% faster than the conventional ARQ based retransmission method.','7th International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability',1,'R.

First, the User QoS Assessment (UQA) and Context QoS Assessment (CQA) are proposed, respectively. Then, through the performance influence on the WSN service by the variations in their context, a Fuzzy mechanism is further developed to aggregate the UQA and the CQA.

A hospital is one of the most complex organizations, where patient information has not only legal and economic implications but, more importantly, an impact on the patient’s health. Imaging studies include medical images, patient identification data, and proprietary information of the study; these data are contained in the storage device of a PACS. This system must preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient information. There are techniques such as firewalls, encryption, and data encapsulation that contribute to the protection of information. In addition, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard and the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations are also used to protect the patient clinical data. However, these techniques are not systematically applied to the picture and archiving and communication system (PACS) in most cases and are not sufficient to ensure the integrity of the images and associated data during transmission.

For this purpose, we look at three provider-driven case studies based on the common three layers of cloud computing: Infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS) and software (SaaS) as a service. These shall be complemented by a fourth, independent systems integration perspective. We extract common migration process activities for the layer-specific processes and discuss commonalities, differences and open issues. The results presented are based on expert interviews and focus groups held with major international cloud solution providers and independent consultants.','',1,'Claus PahlHuanhuan XiongRay Walshe','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(672,'Tool Demonstration of the Transformation Judge','2012','0','','Abstract The transformation judge is a novel system for the automatic evaluation and comparison of graph and model transformations that have been submitted as solutions for common transformation tasks such as those accepted as case studies for the transformation tool contest. The most important feature of this system is the correctness check that is done by black-box-testing. But also performance data and other information about the solutions are collected. So, for academic as well as industrial users of transformation tools, the judge could be a good starting point for choosing a particular transformation tool for their respective task, since they can easily explore and compare different solutions for similar tasks.

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a promising design philosophy embraced by mobile computing and cloud computing communities to stimulate portable, complex application using prefabricated building blocks called Services. Utilizing distant cloud resources to host and run Services is hampered by long WAN latency. Exploiting mobile devices in vicinity alleviates long WAN latency, while creates new set of issues like Service publishing and discovery as well as clientserver security, reliability, and Service availability. In this paper, we propose a market-oriented architecture based on SOA to stimulate publishing, discovering, and hosting Services on nearby mobiles, which reduces long WAN latency and creates a business opportunity that encourages mobile owners to embrace Service hosting. Group of mobile phones simulate a nearby cloud computing platform. We create new role of Service host by enabling unskilled mobile owners/users to host Services developed by skilled developers.

Such automated translation would result in significant failure and cost reduction in application development and maintenance, particularly in those complex applications based on compositions and choreographies of services. In this paper we present a framework which makes a step forward to solve this dilemma. The framework supports the engineering of composite service security and trust requirements directly derived from the organisational needs expressed for such service.

However, existing large-scale business applications inherently do not support multi-tenancy. This hinders these applications\' vendors from adopting the cloud model. Thus reengineering such applications to support multi-tenancy has become a key requirement.

SMURF is based on our new re-aspects concept where a given system modification to disable, modify, replace or inject code is encapsulated in a re-aspect. SMURF realizes given system modifications (captured as re-aspects) by automating both change impact analysis and change propagation processes.

Once a set of services fulfilling users\' functional requirements are founded, one of these services invoked by the users depends mostly on the Quality of Services (QoS), particularly security, trust, and reputation. This paper proposes a trust management model to support service discovery and selection based on QoS. We define a quantitative trust evaluating method for dynamic service discovery and selection. The proposed model makes service consumers get trustworthy services possible. Our mechanism uses consumers\' feedback to describe the trust degree of services and service providers.

Such transformation is only possible with the coupling of an information and communication technology infrastructure to the existing power distribution grid. Given the scale and the interoperability requirements of such future system, service-oriented architectures (SOAs) are seen as one of the reference models and are considered already in many of the proposed standards for the smart grid (e.g., IEC-62325 and OASIS eMIX). Beyond the technical issues of what the service-oriented architectures of the smart grid will look like, there is a pressing question about what the added value for the end user could be. Clearly, the operators need to guarantee availability and security of supply, but why should the end users care? In this paper, we explore a scenario in which the end users can both consume and produce small quantities of energy and can trade these quantities in an open and deregulated market. For the trading, they delegate software agents that can fully interoperate and interact with one another thus taking advantage of the SOA. In particular, the agents have strategies, inspired from game theory, to take advantage of a service-oriented smart grid market and give profit to their delegators, while implicitly helping balancing the power grid. The proposal is implemented with simulated agents and interaction with existing Web services. To show the advantage of the agent with strategies, we compare our approach with the “base” agent one by means of simulations, highlighting the advantages of the proposal.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Nicola CapodieciGiuliano Andrea PaganiGiacomo CabriMarco Aiello','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(694,'Design and implementation of police comprehensive information platform based on SOA','2012','0','Service Oriented Architecture (SOA);Web services;comprehensive information platform;information sharing;requestservice platform','Aiming at the problems of traditional mode of information construction and according to the demands of public security business, this paper firstly introduce the principle of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework, and put forward the system structure of request-service platform.

Integrated service delivery (ISD) is a way to let networked service providers offer services to their clients by bundling selected services offered by each provider so that clients do not have to deal with each single provider anymore. Designing such a network is a complicated endeavor as independent organizations need to collaborate and should understand how their activities are dependent on each other. Communication of events is necessary to deal with unpredictable and complex processes in such a network. In contrast with conventional event-driven architecture and service-oriented architecture (SOA) approaches, the hybrid model of event-driven interactions and SOA offers the required flexibility to realize ISD. This flexibility is realized by integrating not only services but also the processes of the different service providers to supply such services. A design science approach has been applied resulting in a detailed and formalized design of an event-driven service-oriented architecture (EDSOA). The EDSOA has been illustrated to show how ISD is realized with support of the architecture in a scenario concerning an application for a temporary residence permit by an immigrant. An evaluative workshop has been conducted which reflected that the following criteria are most important for successful organizational adoption of the EDSOA: expected usefulness, fit with organizational standards, use of trusted technology, and ease of maintenance.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',2,'Sietse OverbeekMarijn JanssenPatrick van Bommel','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(696,'An Integrated Approach for Identity and Access Management in a SOA Context','2011','9','SAML, SOAP, WS-BPEL, WSsecurity, identity and access management','Proceedings of the 16th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies','',2,'Waldemar  Hummer and Patrick  Gaubatz and Mark  Strembeck and Uwe  Zdun and Schahram  Dustdar','acm/bpel security.csv','acm','\0'),(697,'Towards a Service Friendly Cloud Ecosystem','2012','4','cloud governance;cloud management;platform-as-a-service;service lifecycle','After the large penetration of Cloud Computing, more and more developers are taking into account migrating their applications to the Cloud, in order to take advantage of the characteristics of this new environment.

Our work aims to propose an approach for risk management which is based on the ISO/IEC 27005:2011 standard: we propose a development of this standard (by an extension of Annex D) so that it can fully take into account the type \"service\" as web services and cloud services. Indeed, a world of services is not limited to link interconnected systems, it is more a relationship between customer and supplier, where notions of trust, accountability, trace ability and governance are developed. Following this study we introduce a new security criterion, controllability, to ensure that a company keeps control of its information even if it uses such outsourced services.','Social Computing (SocialCom), 2013 International Conference on',1,'V.

We offer the basic principles how to create domain-specific model transformation languages which can be used by developers relying only on familiar modelling concepts.

After a much troubled start related to scaling challenges and architecture complexity during the first deliverable, the project was turnaround and the second and third deliverables were portrayed fairly successful by both supplier and customer. From a practitioner’s perspective, we found that novel practices emerged through out the project that improved the way of working – especially across teams and stakeholders.

This optimal balance is very important for delivering better service quality to users and keeping costs under control through efficient resource allocation. In this paper we suggest optimal strategies for managing system trustworthiness in two different contexts. In the first one the provider has limited information about the users’ trustworthiness preferences, which have to be satisfied on every transaction. In the second context, the provider knows what the effect of possible outcomes on customer’s trust level and, given that the customer will perform a certain number of transactions, would like to know whether the system trustworthiness should be managed at any point in time in order to meet customer’s expectations in a cost-effective way.

It is shown that design patterns —good solutions to recurring design problems—improve the design quality and facilitate maintenance and evolution of software systems.

Therefore, the detection of REST (anti)patterns is essential for improving the maintenance and evolution of RESTful systems. Until now, however, no approach has been proposed. In this paper, we propose SODA-R (Service Oriented Detection for Antipatterns in REST ), a heuristics-based approach to detect (anti)patterns in RESTful systems. We define detection heuristics for eight REST antipatterns and five patterns, and perform their detection on a set of 12 widely-used REST APIs including BestBuy, Facebook, and DropBox. The results show that SODA-R can perform the detection of REST (anti)patterns with high accuracy. We also found that Twitter and DropBox are not well-designed, i.e. , contain more antipatterns.

However, due to differences in system requirements and resource constraints in devices, there exist variations in these technologies, standards, and platforms. Consequently, application silos are formed. In contrast to the freedom of choice attained by a range of options, the heterogeneity of the technologies is a critical interoperability challenge faced by IoT systems. Moreover, IoT is also limited to address new requirements that arise due to the nature of the majority of smart devices. These requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, are hardly satisfied by the current IoT technologies following the end-to-end model inherited from the Internet. This paper introduces a lightweight, distributed, and embedded service bus called LISA which follows a Node Centric Networking architecture. LISA is designed to provide interoperability for resource-constrained devices in IoT. It also enables a natural way of embracing the new IoT requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, through node centric networking. LISA provides a simple application programming interface for developers, hiding the variations in platform, protocol or physical network, thus facilitating interoperability in IoT systems. LISA is inspired by network on terminal architecture (NoTA), a service centric open architecture originated by Nokia Research Center.

In particular, differentiating between very similar offers satisfying the same number of client constraints is still a challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel semantic scoring approach that helps clients to select the most appropriate service offer according to their intentions. Our approach detects direct and indirect semantic correspondences between these intentions and the available offers using ontological models. It fairly evaluates these offers and ranks them according to their semantic closeness to the client intentions taking into account both functional and QoS properties. Our ranking is based on a deep examination of provider offers and can distinguish between services that look the same for non expert clients.','',1,'Ikbel GuidaraKaouthar FakhfakhTarak Chaari','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(723,'An extensibility of THEMIS billing system for the cloud computing environment','2012','0','Records;pricing and resource allocation;transaction processing;verification','With the advent and acceptance of cloud computing the ability to record and account for the usage of cloud resources in a convincing and capricious way has become critical for cloud service providers and users alike.

Traditional billing systems are not enough in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and no obstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations.

Moreover, to provide a falsification-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. From the perspective of extensibility, THEMIS is moreover applicable to various target services as well to improve the accountability of each service by applying more monitoring techniques to S-Mon.

We study monotonicity and provide sufficient conditions for it. We then propose a comprehensive theory and methodology for monotonic orchestrations.

Monotonicity provides the rationale for a contract-based approach to QoS-aware management.

This manuscript presents a 2nd generation MIDG replacing the Globus Toolkit with a new system architecture that implements the IHE XDS-i integration profile. Implementation and evaluation were conducted using a 3-site interdisciplinary test-bed at the University of Southern California. Methods The 2nd generation MIDG design architecture replaces the initial design’s Globus Toolkit with dedicated web services and XML-based messaging for dedicated management and delivery of multi-modality DICOM imaging datasets. The Cross-enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging (XDS-i) integration profile from the field of enterprise radiology informatics was adopted into the MIDG design because streamlined image registration, management, and distribution dataflow are likewise needed in preclinical imaging informatics systems as in enterprise PACS application. Implementation of the MIDG is demonstrated at the University of Southern California Molecular Imaging Center (MIC) and two other sites with specified hardware, software, and network bandwidth. Results Evaluation of the MIDG involves data upload, download, and fault-tolerance testing scenarios using multi-modality animal imaging datasets collected at the USC Molecular Imaging Center. The upload, download, and fault-tolerance tests of the MIDG were performed multiple times using 12 collected animal study datasets. Upload and download times demonstrated reproducibility and improved real-world performance. Fault-tolerance tests showed that automated failover between Grid Node Servers has minimal impact on normal download times.

Hence, there is a need for these business process models to be managed effectively. For effective business process model management, being able to efficiently query large amount of business process models is essential. For example, it is preferable to find a similar or related model to customize, rather than building a new one from scratch. This would not only save time, but would also be less error-prone and more coherent with the existing models of the enterprise. Querying large amounts of business process models efficiently is also vital during company amalgamation, in which business process models from multiple companies need to be examined and integrated. This paper provides: an overview of the field of querying business process models; a summary of its literature; and a list of challenges (and some potential solutions) that have yet to be addressed. In particular, we aim to compare the differences between querying business process models and general graph querying. We also discuss literature work from graph querying research that can be used when querying business process models.','World Wide Web',2,'Jianmin WangTao JinRaymond K.

The conversion of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars for biofuels production requires the use of enzyme cocktails that can efficiently and economically hydrolyze lignocellulosic biomass. As many fungi naturally break down lignocellulose, the identification and characterization of the enzymes involved is a key challenge in the research and development of biomass-derived products and fuels. One approach to meeting this challenge is to mine the rapidly-expanding repertoire of microbial genomes for enzymes with the appropriate catalytic properties.

An ongoing challenge is to select the appropriate technologies and combine them in a coherent system that brings measurable improvements to the users. We present our ongoing development of a semantic infrastructure in support of genomics-based lignocellulose research.

However, with the paradigm shift brought by cloud computing and with offerings of Platforms and Infrastructure as services, execution level predictability is mandating an increased importance. Existing Web services middleware are optimised for throughput with unconditional acceptance of requests and execution in a best-effort manner. While achieving perceived levels of throughput, they also result in highly unpredictable execution times. This paper presents a generic set of guidelines, algorithms and software engineering techniques that enable service execution to complete within a given deadline. The proposed algorithms accept requests for execution based on their laxity and executes them to meet requested deadlines. An introduced admission control mechanism results in a large range of laxities, enabling more requests to be scheduled together by phasing out their execution. Specialised development libraries and operating systems empower them with increased control over execution. Two widely used Web services middleware products were enhanced using these techniques. The two systems are compared with their unmodified versions to measure the predictability gain achieved. Empirical evidence confirms that the enhancements made enable these systems to achieve more than 90% of the deadlines under any type of traffic, while the unmodified versions achieve less than 10% of the deadlines in high traffic conditions. Predictability of execution achieved through these techniques, would open up new application areas such as industrial control systems, avionics, robotics and financial trading systems to the use of Web services as a middleware platform.','World Wide Web',1,'Vidura Gamini AbhayaZahir TariPeter Bertok','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(745,'R&D challenges and solutions for highly complex distributed systems: a middleware perspective','2012','4',' Highly complex distributed systems Middleware Quality of service','Abstract Highly complex distributed systems (HCDSs) are characterized by a large number of mission-critical, heterogeneous inter-dependent subsystems executing concurrently with diverse—often conflicting—quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.

However, as they process the system’s source code, they are easily misled by design deficiencies (e.g., violations of component encapsulation) which leaked into the code during the system’s evolution. Despite the high impact of design deficiencies on the quality of the resulting software architecture models, none of the surveyed related works is able to cope with them during the reverse engineering process. Therefore, we have developed the Archimetrix approach which semiautomatically recovers the system’s concrete architecture in a formal model while simultaneously detecting and removing design deficiencies. We have validated Archimetrix on a case study system and two implementation variants of the CoCoME benchmark system. Results show that the removal of relevant design deficiencies leads to an architecture model which more closely matches the system’s conceptual architecture.','Software & Systems Modeling',1,'Markus von DettenMarie Christin PlateniusSteffen Becker','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(750,'Using Bayesian networks for highly available cloud-based web applications','2015','0',' Model-driven engineering Dependability evaluation Service dependability Cloud resource allocation','Abstract Bayesian networks have demonstrated their capability in several applications spanning from reasoning under uncertainty in artificial intelligence to dependability modelling and analysis.

Mobile devices are, however, still intrinsically limited by low bandwidth, computing power, and battery lifetime. Therefore, the computing power of computational clouds is tapped on demand basis for mitigating resources limitations in mobile devices. Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is believed to be able to leverage cloud application processing services for alleviating the computing limitations of smartphones. In MCC, application offloading is implemented as a significant software level solution for sharing the application processing load of smartphones. The challenging aspect of application offloading frameworks is the resources intensive mechanism of runtime profiling and partitioning of elastic mobile applications, which involves additional computing resources utilization on Smart Mobile Devices (SMDs). This paper investigates the overhead of runtime application partitioning on SMD by analyzing additional resources utilization on SMD in the mechanism of runtime application profiling and partitioning. We evaluate the mechanism of runtime application partitioning on SMDs in the SmartSim simulation environment and validate the overhead of runtime application profiling by running prototype application in the real mobile computing environment. Empirical results indicate that additional computing resources are utilized in runtime application profiling and partitioning.

For D-PKE it is not clear and depends on details of the definition. In particular we can show it in the non-uniform case but not in the uniform case. • The power of selective-opening attacks (SOA) comes from an adversary’s ability, upon corrupting a sender, to learn not just the message but also the coins used for encryption. For R-PKE, security is achievable. For D-PKE, where there are no coins, one’s first impression may be that SOAs are vacuous and security should be easily achievable. We show instead that SOA-security is impossible, meaning no D-PKE scheme can achieve it. • For R-PKE, single-user security implies multi-user security, but we show that there are D-PKE schemes secure for a single user and insecure with two users. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.','',1,'Bellare M., Dowsley R., Keelveedhi S.','scopus/soa security.csv','scopus',''),(766,'Towards a construction of an intelligent business process based on cloud services and driven by degree of similarity and QoS','2016','1',' Business process construction Knowledge and competence management Similarity degrees Cloud services Quality of service Agent-based cloud services','Abstract Knowledge and competence management in companies focus on resources allocation to business activities, knowledge management approaches promise a positive impact on cost structures.

A three-dimensional finite element method taking the rotational motion of tool into account is proposed. The simulation consists of three operations including loading, unloading, and cooling. The influences of different grinding conditions (grinding speed and grinding depth) on the residual stress field are analyzed. Results show that the main grinding force comes from normal rather than tangential direction due to the tool’s negative rake angle and their ratio is in the range of 1.2 to 1.7. The residual stress state on the finished surface is either tensile or compressive depending on various grinding condition; even both states may exist simultaneously. Further study shows that the ultra-high speed grinding can obtain lower surface residual tensile stress comparing with the high-speed grinding. Besides, a larger grinding depth is not advantage for obtaining a better machined quality in subsurface layer as the tensile maximum principal stress is also larger. Finally, the effects of different grinding conditions on residual stress scatters are analyzed utilizing mathematical statistic method. Results show that both smaller grinding depth and higher grinding speed are beneficial to achieve a better consistency of residual stress.','The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology',1,'Jianbin ChenQihong FangLiangchi Zhang','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(768,'Dynamic policies for supporting quality of service in service-oriented architecture','2010','0','BPEL;SOA;Security Policy;Web Services;Workflow','This paper describes how to simultaneously support both dynamic policies and separation of concerns when developing an SOA application.

However, the Internet heterogeneous environment, where each provider has its own policies, infrastructure and business goals, hinders the deployment of more advanced communication services. This paper presents a Quality of Service (QoS) for Inter-Domain Services (QIDS) model that allows inter-domain QoS-aware services to be defined, configured, and adapted in a dynamic and on-demand fashion, among service providers. This is accomplished by: 1) the use of a common communication channel (business layer) where service providers publish and search for services, and interact with each other to contract and manage these services; 2) the templates to specify the business and technical characteristics of the services; 3) the automatic composition of services using service elements (smaller services) according to performance and service-specific QoS parameters; and 4) the creation and enforcement of configuration rules for the underlying infrastructure.

In cloud environments, software re services collaborate with other complementary services to provide complete solutions to end users. The service selection is performed based on QoS requirements submitted by end users. Software providers alone cannot guarantee users’ QoS requirements. These requirements must be end-to-end, representing all collaborating services in a cloud solution. In this paper, we propose a prediction model to compute end-to-end QoS values for vertically composed services which are composed of three types of cloud services: software (SaaS), infrastructure (IaaS) and data (DaaS) services. These values can be used during the service selection and recommendation process. Our model exploits historical QoS values and cloud service and user information to predict unknown end-to-end QoS values of composite services. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other prediction models in terms of the prediction accuracy. We also study the impact of different parameters on the prediction results. In the experiments, we used real cloud services’ QoS data collected using our developed QoS monitoring and collecting system.','Cluster Computing',1,'Raed KarimChen DingAli MiriMd Shahinur Rahman','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(782,'eWALL: An Intelligent Caring Home Environment Offering Personalized Context-Aware Applications Based on Advanced Sensing','2016','3',' Caring home eHealth Advanced sensing Personalized context-aware applications','Abstract Independent living of senior citizens is one of the main challenges linked to the ageing population.

This paper considers the issue of aligning the compliance requirements in a BN with the monitoring requirements they induce on the BN participants when change (or evolution) occurs. We first provide a conceptual model of BNs and their compliance requirements, introducing the concept of monitoring capabilities induced by compliance requirements. Then, we present a set of mechanisms to ensure consistency between the monitoring and compliance requirements when BNs evolve, e.g. tasks are delegated or backsourced in-house. Eventually, we discuss a prototype implementation of our framework, which also implements a set of metrics to check the status of a BN in respect of compliance monitorability.','',2,'Marco Comuzzi','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(798,'The Intelligent RFID Information Security Integrated Antenna Arrays System Based on SOA','2012','2',' RFID RSA Information security Heterogeneous WMN SOA','Abstract Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology system is quickly evolved many applications to manage personnel can be more efficient for automation systems.

Moreover, every one of the existing purported grid technologies actually violates the published grid DSSA. In response to this, based on an analysis of the source code, documentation, and usage of eighteen of the most pervasive grid technologies, we have significantly refined the original grid DSSA. We demonstrate that this DSSA much more closely matches the grid technologies studied. Our refinements allow us to more definitively identify a software system as a grid technology, and distinguish it from software libraries, middleware, and frameworks.','Journal of Grid Computing',1,'Chris A.

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database.

Various SaaS customization strategies can be used from light customization with manual coding to heavy customization where the SaaS system and its underlying PaaS systems are customized together. Multi-tenancy architecture is an important feature of a SaaS and various trade-offs including security isolation, performance, and engineering effort need to be considered. It is important for a SaaS system to have multi-level redundancy and recovery mechanisms, and the SaaS system needs to coordinate these with the underlying PaaS system.

Acquiring a system can be done via designing and manufacturing it by the business itself, or via commissioning it to somebody else. Alternatively, a generic system can be bought and configured according to the business process model created. The traditional approach has a number of risks that become visible only during the latest phase of introducing the system in the organizational practice, e.g., when it becomes clear that the system does not fit the business and/or people who work in it. These risks could be mitigated by using an agile approach to the development of business processes. In agile approach: (a) the phases of process modeling, IT-system design, and manufacturing are merged into one, and (b) instead of using one big cycle, a series of smaller development cycles is used. The paper discusses what is needed to implement the agile approach, and in which business situations the agile approach is the most appropriate. Examples of tools to support agile development are presented and analyzed. The results presented in the paper have been achieved based on the knowledge transformation perspective along the lines suggested by Nonaka in SECI model.

In line with this trend, safety critical services such as e-commerce and on-line financial service have now mostly been used through the mobile environment. Since the Internet service is made up of interaction between the user and the service provider, service safety is based on mutual trust between them. In other words, the user terminal and the service provider system should have confidence in the identities of each other. In heterogeneous mobile network, the user terminal can get access to the service system through diverse access networks simultaneously. So, service provider cannot distinguish which is a valid access for service.

However, it would be beneficial if users can specify the requirements during run-time, based on the outcome of the previous services executed. In general, business applications follow a predefined order and consequently the composition process can follow a template of business activities. Existing works on dynamic web service composition either separate the composition and execution phases distinctly or perform them in an interleaved fashion. The former approach cannot adapt to changes in run-time whereas the latter can select services based on the outcome of previous service executions. However, the interleaved approach does not support business activities that have a specific ordering among them.

Consequently, the traditional approach is to separately address human performances and system performances. We argue that results from early-cycle system performance evaluation should be exploited by interaction designers to produce “performance-informed” design iteration, then leading to a performance-aware self-adaptive interaction environment, according to a vision bridging the two communities.','',1,'Tania Di MascioLaura TarantinoGiovanni De Gasperis','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(830,'Security (hyper-)properties in workflow systems: From specification to verification?','2014','','','Provable security guarantees for software systems are highly desirable.

Several industrial studies have shown that compliance management is a daunting task, and organizations are still struggling and spending billions of dollars annually to ensure and prove their compliance. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive compliance management framework with a main focus on design-time compliance management as a first step towards a preventive lifetime compliance support. The framework enables the automation of compliance-related activities that are amenable to automation, and therefore can significantly reduce the expenditures spent on compliance. It can help experts to carry out their work more efficiently, cut the time spent on tedious manual activities, and reduce potential human errors. An evident candidate compliance activity for automation is the compliance checking, which can be achieved by utilizing formal reasoning and verification techniques. However, formal languages are well known of their complexity as only versed users in mathematical theories and formal logics are able to use and understand them. However, this is generally not the case with business and compliance practitioners. Therefore, in the heart of the compliance management framework, we introduce the Compliance Request Language (CRL), which is formally grounded on temporal logic and enables the abstract pattern-based specification of compliance requirements. CRL constitutes a series of compliance patterns that spans three structural facets of business processes; control flow, employed resources and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, CRL supports the specification of compensations and non-monotonic requirements, which permit the relaxation of some compliance requirements to handle exceptional situations. An integrated tool suite has been developed as an instantiation artefact, and the validation of the approach is undertaken in several directions, which includes internal validity, controlled experiments, and functional testing.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Amal ElgammalOktay TuretkenWillem-Jan van den HeuvelMike Papazoglou','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(833,'Much Ado about Security Appeal: Cloud Provider Collaborations and Their Risks','2012','4',' cloud computing security cloud collaborations data privacy data protection security broker','Abstract The lack of capacity, unplanned outages of sub-contractors, a disaster recovery plan, acquisitions, or other financial goals may force cloud providers to enter into collaborations with other cloud providers.

The overall cost of the Japan disaster alone is estimated to have exceeded 300 billion USD. Transportation and telecommunications play a critical role in disaster response and management in order to minimize loss of human life, economic cost and disruptions. Our research is concerned with developing emergency response systems for disasters of various scales with a focus on transportation systems, which exploit ICT developments. In this paper, we leverage Intelligent Transportation Systems including Vehicular Ad hoc Networks, mobile and Cloud Computing technologies to propose an intelligent disaster management system. The system is intelligent because it is able to gather information from multiple sources and locations, including from the point of incident, and is able to let vehicles make effective strategies and decisions of communication protocols usage. Hybrid vehicular communications based on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure protocols are opportunistically exploited. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through modelling the impact of a disaster on a real city transport environment and comparing it with the case where our disaster management system was in place. We report great benefits derived from the adoption of our proposed system in terms of improved and balanced traffic flow and smooth evacuation.','',1,'Zubaida AlazawiMohmmad B.

Dynamic reconfiguration in the service-oriented approach, involves replacing the statically composed services with some other ones, during run-time, only when it is necessary. This necessity might arise due to the need to accommodate change in user requirements, sudden unavailability of services or to keep up the non-functional requirements agreed in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Dynamic composition is another approach, where each service is selected and composed at run-time. This approach provides more flexibility in selecting appropriate services during run-time as opposed to the static composition. However, there is a possibility of an additional overhead, compared to dynamic reconfiguration. This paper discusses an approach for SLA aware dynamic reconfiguration, that happens for the same instance of execution and it has also been captured as a pattern named I-RAILS. The various ways of dynamically reconfiguring the services has been illustrated with a case study application namely the Safe Building Security system.

Such processes typically span interactions between people and services across globally distributed companies. Web services and SOA are the defacto technology to implement compositions of humans and services. The increasing complexity of compositions and the distribution of people and services require adaptive and context-aware interaction models. To support complex interaction scenarios, we introduce a mixed service-oriented system composed of both human-provided and Software-Based Services (SBSs) interacting to perform joint activities or to solve emerging problems. However, competencies of people evolve over time, thereby requiring approaches for the automated management of actor skills, reputation, and trust. Discovering the right actor in mixed service-oriented systems is challenging due to scale and temporary nature of collaborations. We present a novel approach addressing the need for flexible involvement of experts and knowledge workers in distributed collaborations. We argue that the automated inference of trust between members is a key factor for successful collaborations. Instead of following a security perspective on trust, we focus on dynamic trust in collaborative networks. We discuss Human-Provided Services (HPSs) and an approach for managing user preferences and network structures. HPS allows experts to offer their skills and capabilities as services that can be requested on demand.

The aim of this paper is thus not to create one new general data architecture that would fail to be adopted by each and any individual user community. Instead this contribution aims to design a reference model with abstract entities that is able to federate existing concrete infrastructures under one umbrella. A reference model is an abstract framework for understanding significant entities and relationships between them and thus helps to understand existing data infrastructures when comparing them in terms of functionality, services, and boundary conditions. A derived architecture from such a reference model then can be used to create a federated architecture that builds on the existing infrastructures that could align to a major common vision. This common vision is named as ’ScienceTube’ as part of this contribution that determines the high-level goal that the reference model aims to support. This paper will describe how a well-focused use case around data replication and its related activities in the EUDAT project aim to provide a first step towards this vision. Concrete stakeholder requirements arising from scientific end users such as those of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructure (ESFRI) projects underpin this contribution with clear evidence that the EUDAT activities are bottom-up thus providing real solutions towards the so often only described ’high-level big data challenges’.

Then we define a tool that, starting from a high-level declaration of the desired system, computes a model instance of such system that optimally distributes objects over available deployment components.','',2,'Stijn de GouwMichael LienhardtJacopo MauroBehrooz NobakhtGianluigi Zavattaro','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(857,'Decision-Making Based on Incident Data Analysis','2014','3','cloud computing;decision support;risk management;simulation evaluation','The intertwining of service-oriented architectures, service management concepts and cloud computing services leads to a new form of service landscapes.

In addition, flexibility has become an important managerial variable in service management, which adds even more complexity to service management decisions. To address this rise of complexity, we analyse service sourcing based on a formal model and propose a risk-aware decision model for service sourcing.

Security play vital role during the design, development and operation of SOA application. However, analysis of today\'s software development approaches reveals that the engineering of security into the system design is often neglected. Currently security is incorporated in SOA applications in an ad-hoc manner and integrated during the applications development phase or administration phase or it is out sourced. In practice security is not defined during the early phases of software development and left onto developers. Properly configuring security requirements in SOA applications is quite difficult for developers because they are not security experts; furthermore, SOA security is cross-domain and all required information is not available at downstream phases. This reveals the importance of adding security objectives in early development phases i.e. at design phase by the business process expert. However, a business process expert is unable to specify security objectives due to lake of security modelling elements in a general purpose modelling languages. As a result, he/she either ignores the security objectives in a business process model or indicates them in textual way. The post-hoc, low-level integration of security has a negative impact on resulting SOA applications. A Domain Specific Language named \"UML-SOA-Sec\" is proposed for the Model driven development of secure SOA systems based on the UML.

In this paper, we study these heterogeneous interaction paradigms, connected through an eXtensible Service Bus proposed in the CHOReOS project. As the functioning of such choreographies is dependent on the Quality of Service (QoS) performance of participating entities, an intricate analysis of interaction paradigms and their effect on QoS metrics is needed. We study the composition of QoS metrics in heterogeneous choreographies, and the subsequent tradeoffs. This produces interesting insights such as selection of a particular system and its middleware during design time or end-to-end QoS expectation/guarantees during runtime. Non-parametric hypothesis tests are applied to systems, where QoS dependent services may be replaced at runtime to prevent deterioration in performance.','',2,'Ajay KattepurNikolaos GeorgantasValérie Issarny','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer','\0'),(868,'Service-oriented network architecture: Significant issues and principles of communication','2015','','Flexible network; Future internet; Service; Service-oriented architecture; Service-oriented network architecture; SOA; SONATE','The internet is not designed for any specific application purposes, rather it is for generic and evolve purposes.

Choreographies should also be able to adapt to changes in its non-functional requirements, such as response time, and especially for large-scale choreographies, adaptation strategies need to be automated and scale well. However, the body of knowledge regarding choreography adaptation approaches has not yet been consolidated and systematically evaluated. By means of a systematic literature review, in which we examined seven scientific paper sources, we identified and analyzed the state-of-the-art in choreography adaptation. We found 24 relevant primary studies and grouped them into six categories: model-based, measurement-based, multi-agent-based, formal method-based, semantic reasoning-based, and proxy layer-based. We analyzed (i) how each strategy deals with different types of requirements, (ii) what their required degree of human intervention is, (iii) how the different studies considered scalability, (iv) what implementations are currently available, and (v) which choreography languages are employed. From the selected studies, we extracted key examples of choreography adaptation usage and analyzed the terminology they adopted with respect to dynamic adaptation. We found out that more attention has been devoted to functional requirements and automated adaptation; only one work performs scalability evaluation; and most studies present some sort of implementation and use a specific choreography notation.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Leonardo A.

Different smart grid services in different control centers collaborate to realize the real-time control and protection of power systems. The publish/subscribe paradigm makes smart grid service collaborations more real-time and flexible because of the space, time and control decoupling of event producer and consumer, which can be used to establish an appropriate communication infrastructure. Unfortunately, a publish/ subscribe-based smart grid service does not know who consumes its events, and consumers do not know who produces the events either. In this environment, the smart grid service cannot directly control access because of anonymous and indirect service interactions. To address the above issues, this paper at first describes the service communication foundation for smart grid services, and then defines their security model supporting data-centric methodology. Based on such model, underpinning network capabilities can be integrated to help smart grid services control access. The key point in our access control solution is to preserve the service interaction characteristics of the publish/subscribe-based smart grid services: anonymous, multicast and session-control. So two special kinds of event types are used to accomplish authorization request and granting with being consistent with the publish/subscribe paradigm.

This is achieved by sharing of resources and service instances among multiple “tenants” of the cloud-hosted application. However, supporting multi-tenancy adds more complexity to SaaS applications required capabilities. Security is one of these key requirements that must be addressed when engineering multi-tenant SaaS applications. The sharing of resources among tenants—i.e. multi-tenancy—increases tenants’ concerns about the security of their cloud-hosted assets. Compounding this, existing traditional security engineering approaches do not fit well with the multi-tenancy application model where tenants and their security requirements often emerge after the applications and services were first developed. The resultant applications do not usually support diverse security capabilities based on different tenants’ needs, some of which may change at run-time i.e. after cloud application deployment. We introduce a novel model-driven security engineering approach for multi-tenant, cloud-hosted SaaS applications. Our approach is based on externalizing security from the underlying SaaS application, allowing both application/service and security to evolve at runtime. Multiple security sets can be enforced on the same application instance based on different tenants’ security requirements. We use abstract models to capture service provider and multiple tenants’ security requirements and then generate security integration and configurations at runtime. We use dependency injection and dynamic weaving via Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to integrate security within critical application/service entities at runtime. We explain our approach, architecture and implementation details, discuss a usage example, and present an evaluation of our approach on a set of open source web applications.','Automated Software Engineering',1,'Mohamed AlmorsyJohn GrundyAmani S.

Often, the quality of a process discovery algorithm is measured by quantifying to what extent the resulting model can reproduce the behavior in the log, i.e. replay fitness. At the same time, there are many other metrics that compare a model with recorded behavior in terms of the precision of the model and the extent to which the model generalizes the behavior in the log. Furthermore, several metrics exist to measure the complexity of a model irrespective of the log. In this paper, we show that existing process discovery algorithms typically consider at most two out of the four main quality dimensions: replay fitness , precision , generalization and simplicity . Moreover, existing approaches can not steer the discovery process based on user-defined weights for the four quality dimensions. This paper also presents the ETM algorithm which allows the user to seamlessly steer the discovery process based on preferences with respect to the four quality dimensions. We show that all dimensions are important for process discovery. However, it only makes sense to consider precision, generalization and simplicity if the replay fitness is acceptable.','',2,'Joos C.

The architecture is normally documented in the Software Architecture Document (SAD), which tends to be a large and complex technical description, and does not always address the information needs of every stakeholder. Individual stakeholders are interested in different, sometimes overlapping, subsets of the SAD and they also require varying levels of detail. As a consequence, stakeholders are affected by an information overload problem, which in practice discourages the usage of the architectural knowledge and diminishes its value for the organization. Methods This work presents a semi-automated approach to recommend relevant contents of a given SAD to specific stakeholder profiles. Our approach assumes that SADs are hosted in Wikis, which not only favor communication and interactions among stakeholders, but also enable us to apply User Profiling techniques to infer stakeholders’ interests with respect to particular documents. Results We have built a recommendation tool implementing our approach, which was tested in two experiments with Wiki-based SADs. The experiments aimed at assessing the performance reached by our tool when inferring stakeholders’ interests. To this end, precision and recall metrics were used. Conclusions Although preliminary, the results have shown that the recommendations of the tool help to find the architectural documents that best match the stakeholders’ interests.','Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development',1,'Matias NicolettiJorge Andres Diaz-PaceSilvia SchiaffinoAntonela TommaselDaniela Godoy','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(891,'6th International Conference on E-Technologies, MCETECH 2015','2015','','','The proceedings contain 19 papers.

However, SOA-based applications are highly dynamic and liable to change significantly at runtime. This justifies the need for monitoring composed services throughout the lifetime of service execution. In this paper we present a novel framework for monitoring services at runtime and ensuring that services behave as they have promised. The framework enables monitoring of both atomic and composite services and offers high flexibility through the use of Complex Event Processing (CEP).

Such fake web sites lead to fraudulent charges against individuals and corporations. Phishers have a lot of methods to design and host phished web pages, so in reality there cannot be a single solution that can help us combat phishing. As technology advances, the phishing techniques being used are also getting advanced and hence it demands the anti-phishing techniques also to be upgraded and the new techniques are to be included along with the existing methods. But most of the anti-phishing techniques today do not satisfy these criteria. In this paper, we propose service oriented three-layer architecture model for detecting and identifying phishing web sites as it overcomes the shortcomings of existing anti-phishing solutions. This model enables us to separate the user interface layer from the anti-phishing components layer. This is done through web service middleware layer, which provides us with the freedom of building our own anti-phishing components layer in an efficient and flexible way, independent of other layers. Anti-phishing components layer provides a set of reusable components to convert webpage into feature vectors using finest heuristic methods and external repositories of information. The feature vectors act as an input to trained support vector machine classifier to generate phishing label which determines whether a webpage is legitimate or a phishing page. This when experimented, displayed the significance and importance of three-layered architecture model along with combination of heuristics in detection of phishing webpage.

However, most V&V techniques suit a structured and documented development lifecycle, and assume that the system does not evolve after deployment, contrarily to what happens with SOA. Runtime V&V practices represent one possible solution for this problem, but they are not possible to implement without the adjustment of traditional V&V techniques.

This results in an increased complexity of workflow design. As scientists typically design their scientific workflows on their own, this complexity hinders them to concentrate on their core issue, namely the experiments, analyses, or simulations they conduct. In this paper, we present a novel approach to a pattern-based abstraction support for the complex data management in simulation workflows that goes beyond related work in similar research areas. A pattern hierarchy with different abstraction levels enables a separation of concerns according to the skills of different persons involved in workflow design. The goal is that scientists are no longer obliged to specify low-level details of data management in their workflows. We discuss the advantages of this approach and show to what extent it reduces the complexity of simulation workflow design. Furthermore, we illustrate how to map patterns onto executable workflows.

Methods In this paper, we present a cloud-based BIM server framework namely Social BIMCloud that facilitates BIM information exchange through dynamic merging and splitting of building models. The data model of Social BIMCloud is based on but not limited to IFC. The data model of Social BIMCloud was further extended to accommodate social interactions, by studying the formal modes of communication in the AEC industry. An object-based approach to capture and manage social interactions in AEC projects through a BIM-based visual user interface was also developed and demonstrated. Results Social BIMCloud addresses the issues of inefficient data transfer speed and data inconsistency in a distributed environment by facilitating the storage and partial exchange of integrated nD BIM models. Data interoperability is facilitated through open BIM standards such as IFC and direct integration with construction software. High performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and cost effectiveness are facilitated through data partitioning, data replication strategies, multi-node structures, and pay-per-use tariff systems, respectively, through a cloud-based NoSQL database.

In SOA, there are a number of target elements for service remedies, and there can be a number of causes associated with each target element. However, there is not yet a comprehensive taxonomy of causes that is widely accepted. The lack of cause taxonomy results in the limited possibility of remedying the problems in an autonomic way. In this paper, we first present a meta-model, extract all target elements for service fault management, and present a computing model for autonomously managing service faults. Then we define fault taxonomy for each target element and inter-relationships among the elements. Finally, we show prototype implementation using cause taxonomy and conduct experiments with the prototype for validating its applicability and effectiveness.','Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE C',1,'Du Wan CheunHyun Jung LaSoo Dong Kim','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(912,'How Do Software Architects Specify and Validate Quality Requirements?','2014','3',' Software architecture empirical study quality requirements validation','Abstract Software architecture is the result of a design effort aimed at ensuring a certain set of quality attributes.

One strategy to deal with complexity is separation of concerns, which can be addressed using aspect-oriented paradigm. Despite being well researched in programming, this paradigm is still in a preliminary stage in the area of business process management (BPM). While some efforts have been made to introduce aspect orientation in business process modelling, there is no holistic approach with a formal underlying foundation to support aspect-oriented business process design and enactment, and this gap restricts aspect-oriented paradigm from being practically deployed in the area of BPM. Therefore, this paper proposes a sound systematic approach which builds on a formal syntax for modelling aspect-oriented business processes and a Petri Net-based operational semantics for enacting these processes. The approach enables the implementation of software system artefacts as a proof of concept to support design and enactment of aspect-oriented business processes in practice. The approach is demonstrated using a banking case study, where processes are modelled using a concrete notation that conforms to the proposed formal syntax and then executed in a state-of-the-art BPM system where the implemented artefacts are deployed.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Amin JalaliChun OuyangPetia WohedPaul Johannesson','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(926,'Access Control for Human Tasks in Service Oriented Architecture','2008','1','Access Control;BPEL;BPEL4People;Business Process;Web Service','Business process management is designed to make business activity coordination easier and more cost effective.

However, citizens face a practical challenge in formulating coherent information sets from the large volumes of data available to them. These large data volumes materialise due to the increased utilisation of information and communication technologies in urban settings and local authorities’ reliance on such technologies to govern urban settlements efficiently. To encourage effective public participation in urban governance of smart cities, the public needs to be facilitated with the right contextual information about the characteristics and processes of their urban surroundings in order to contribute to the aspects of urban governance that affect them such as socio-economic activities, quality of life, citizens well-being etc. The cities on the other hand face challenges in terms of crowd sourcing with quality data collection and standardisation, services inter-operability, provisioning of computational and data storage infrastructure. Focus In this paper, we highlight the issues that give rise to these multi-faceted challenges for citizens and public administrations of smart cities, identify the artefacts and stakeholders involved at both ends of the spectrum (data/service producers and consumers) and propose a conceptual framework to address these challenges. Based upon this conceptual framework, we present a Cloud-based architecture for context-aware citizen services for smart cities and discuss the components of the architecture through a common smart city scenario. A proof of concept implementation of the proposed architecture is also presented and evaluated.

Subsequently, the extracted features are fused with a sequential classifier. In the proposed system, the random basis features are not stored for security reason. The non-training based on feature extraction followed by a sequential learning contributes to computational efficiency. The overall accuracy is consequently improved via an ensemble of classifiers.

Thus, composition plans play an important role for both communicating business requirements between domain experts and system experts, and serving as a basis for the system implementation. At the same time, ICT systems need to fulfil an increasing number of security and compliance requirements. Thus, there is a demand for integrating security and compliance requirements into composition plans.

The impact on availability is a serious problem on service-oriented platforms. This paper presents SafeStack, a system that can automatically diagnose and patch stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The key technique of our solution is to virtualize memory accesses and move the vulnerable buffer into protected memory regions, which provides a fundamental and effective protection against recurrence of the same attack without stopping normal system execution. We developed a prototype on a Linux system, and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the system using a range of applications. Our experimental results showed that SafeStack can quickly generate runtime patches to successfully handle the attack\'s recurrence. Furthermore, SafeStack only incurs acceptable overhead for the patched applications.','IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing',1,'G. Chen; H. Jin; D. Zou; B. B. Zhou; Z. Liang; W.

Although STSs are fruitfully modeled using normative abstractions such as commitments, a conventional (practical) commitment can capture only part of the story, namely, a debtor’s promise to the creditor to bring about the consequent if the antecedent holds. In contrast, in a dialectical commitment, which we highlight, a debtor asserts to the creditor that the consequent is true if the antecedent is. For example, a customer may dialectically commit to a seller that the product she received is damaged but may not practically commit to damaging the product. We introduce a novel bipartite operationalization of dialectical commitments that separates their objective and subjective aspects and thus avoids the problems arising if we merely treat dialectical like practical commitments. We express that operationalization in temporal logic, developing a verification tool based on NuSMV, a well-known model-checker, to verify if the participants’ interactions comply with the participants’ dialectical commitments. We present a set of modeling patterns that incorporate both practical and dialectical commitments.

Each service provider independently maintains a TSE for itself, which collects and stores users\' reviews about its services without requiring any third trusted authority. The service reviews can then be made available to interested users in making wise service selection decisions. We identify three unique service review attacks, i.e., linkability, rejection, and modification attacks, and develop sophisticated security mechanisms for the TSE to deal with these attacks. Specifically, the basic TSE (bTSE) enables users to distributedly and cooperatively submit their reviews in an integrated chain form by using hierarchical and aggregate signature techniques. It restricts the service providers to reject, modify, or delete the reviews. Thus, the integrity and authenticity of reviews are improved. Further, we extend the bTSE to a Sybil-resisted TSE (SrTSE) to enable the detection of two typical sybil attacks. In the SrTSE, if a user generates multiple reviews toward a vendor in a predefined time slot with different pseudonyms, the real identity of that user will be revealed. Through security analysis and numerical results, we show that the bTSE and the SrTSE effectively resist the service review attacks and the SrTSE additionally detects the sybil attacks in an efficient manner. Through performance evaluation, we show that the bTSE achieves better performance in terms of submission rate and delay than a service review system that does not adopt user cooperation.','IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems',1,'X.

The challenge is addressed with information standards and new approaches to systems integration based on service-oriented architectures. Model-driven development promise utilities that are suitable for software service development in the healthcare domain, but development tools are still immature and their industry uptake is low. The knowledge about how model-driven development tools can become more useful to the healthcare software developers should be strengthened. Approach: This paper presents the ModelHealth toolchain that was created in four design/assess cycles, involving 28 students and 41 professional developers in the period 2007–2010. The toolchain provides design assistance for creating software services based on concepts from the CEN-13940 standard for continuity of care, which facilitates development of interoperable software services. Results: The CEN-13940 standard was successfully incorporated into the ModelHealth Toolchain assisting developers in creating software service design models that adhered to the standard. The developers expressed that improved understanding of the target system, documentation generation, and artifact traceability were essential utilities of the model-driven approach. Conclusion: The paper concludes healthcare domain knowledge can be successfully incorporated in a model-driven development toolchain, providing valuable input to the healthcare software service design process. A set of recommendations on how to incorporate domain specific concepts into model-driven development tools is provided. To our knowledge, no other scientific publications have reported from healthcare specific model-driven tool design and evaluations.

However, such approaches usually assume that the relations among alternative system configurations, environmental parameters and requirements are clearly understood, which is often not true. Moreover, they do not consider the influence of the current configuration of an executing system on adaptation decisions. In this paper, we propose an improved requirements-driven self-adaptation approach that combines goal reasoning and case-based reasoning. In the approach, past experiences of successful adaptations are retained as adaptation cases, which are described by not only requirements violations and contexts, but also currently deployed system configurations. The approach does not depend on a set of original adaptation cases, but employs goal reasoning to provide adaptation solutions when no similar cases are available. Case-based reasoning is used to provide more precise adaptation decisions that better reflect the complex relations among requirements violations, contexts, and current system configurations by utilizing past experiences. To prevent case-based reasoning from getting trapped in suboptimal adaptation solutions, an additional case mutation mechanism is introduced to mutate existing adaptation solutions when necessary. We conduct an experimental study with an online shopping benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that our approach outperforms both a requirements-driven approach and a case-based approach in terms of satisfaction level of quality constraints. The results also confirm the effectiveness of case mutation for producing better adaptation solutions. In addition, we empirically investigate the evolution process of adaptation solutions. The evolution analysis reveals some general evolution trends of adaptation solutions such as different evolution phases.','Requirements Engineering',1,'Wenyi QianXin PengBihuan ChenJohn MylopoulosHuanhuan WangWenyun Zhao','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(951,'Business Process Mining from E-Commerce Web Logs','2013','4','','Abstract The dynamic nature of the Web and its increasing importance as an economic platform create the need of new methods and tools for business efficiency.

In this paper we propose a cloud-based middleware framework, InCloud , for vehicular infotainment application development. The proposed framework follows service oriented architecture in which data filtering and fusion functionalities are delegated to the cloud. Data filtering and fusion reduce the data flow over wireless link. Furthermore, because most of the processing is done on the cloud, the client becomes lightweight and loosely coupled with Internet resources and underlying platforms in vehicles. We also propose a class-based fusion method for combining information from multiple resources on the Internet. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated by developing three infotainment applications for vehicles: context-aware music, news, and an enhanced Direction (eDirection) application.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',1,'Mukesh SainiKazi Masudul AlamHaolin GuoAbdulhameed AlelaiwiAbdulmotaleb El Saddik','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(971,'Security policy conflicts in service-oriented systems','2012','2','Conflict Detection Algorithm; Security Policy','This paper considers methods for knowledge exploitation in security policies for Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) environments, discovering the modality conflicts in particular.

Monolithic software systems are seen as a set of interrelated and geographically distributed services over the Internet. Developers and providers can easily customize services while being able to accommodate a large range of stakeholders. At the core of this service orientation of the whole field of software development are the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) design principles.

Though such practices offer advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and flexibility, those components are not immune to vulnerabilities. It is therefore important for the administrator of some composed service to evaluate the threats of such vulnerabilities accordingly within limited available information. Since almost all the existing efforts (e.g., CVSS) fail to consider specific context-aware information which is the specific character of SOA, they could not be adopted into SOA for scoring vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present VRank, a novel framework for the scoring and ranking of vulnerabilities in SOA. Different from existing efforts, for a given vulnerability, VRank not only considers its intrinsic properties (e.g., exploitability), but also takes into account the contexts of the services having this vulnerability, e.g., what roles they play in the composed service and how critical it is to the security objective of the service. The resulting scoring and ranking of vulnerabilities are thus highly relevant and meaningful to the composed service. We present the detailed design of VRank, and compare it with CVSS. Our experiments indicate VRank is able to provide much more useful ranking lists of vulnerabilities for complex composed services.','Software Security and Reliability (SERE), 2012 IEEE Sixth International Conference on',1,'J.

SOC uses “services” as the unit of functionality of a software application. The massive wave of SOC applications involves considerable energy consumption of servers, which should not be ignored in large-scale computing environment. When a service requirement can be answered by several web services, the energy consumption for each service to reply to the service request may be different. When this happens, web service selection (WSS) is often required to choose appropriate services to maximize global energy efficiency of SOC applications. Accordingly, this paper proposes a Virtual Power Meter Supported Power Consumption Prediction method for WSS (VPMSPCP). VPMSPCP facilitates choosing appropriate services to minimize wasteful electrical energy from the overall environment of SOC applications. According to our empirical proof, there is a correlation between the power consumption of a service and the status of the server where this service resides. We take advantage of this discovery to develop VPMSPCP by combining a ridge regression model with a well-known web service power modeling method. There are mainly two steps to establish VPMSPCP. First, we develop a virtual power meter (VPM) for each server. VPM is used to estimate the average power of a server under a certain status. Second, we apply the VPM to develop VPMSPCP which estimates power consumption of a web service according to the current status of the corresponding servers. Experiments show that VPMSPCP performs well in improving energy saving in WSS.','Personal and Ubiquitous Computing',1,'Jin LiuJiaming JiangXiaohui CuiWei YangXiao Liu','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(997,'Shifting Primes on OpenRISC Processors with Hardware Multiplier','2013','1','','Abstract Shifting primes have proved its efficiency in CPUs without hardware multiplier such as the located at the MSP430 from Texas Instruments.

The work presented in this paper explores the possibility of implementing such a distributed social Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) over Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). This SOA, which would expose re-usable coarse-grained software components in a service ecosystem, differs from traditional SOA because it attempts to counter the centralization existing services, in favour of a fully-distributed service ecosystem where each peer can behave both as service consumer and provider.

The multi-mode, loosely coupled, user-centric nature of modern communications and services, coupled with the diversity of operator business models, ensure that modern end-to-end service provision frequently crosses heterogeneous management and administrative domains. Thus, management approaches that can be applied across organizational boundaries are increasingly important in a wide range of application areas. There are a number of significant, common, complex issues which must be addressed in all technologies and applications that involve federated organizations, yet research has heretofore been mostly confined to particular technical or application areas. The first installment of ManFed.Com addressed this gap by bringing together researchers from a broad array of application and technical areas who shared an interest in cross-domain management. The workshop drew out common themes, problems and issues encountered, and the solutions being designed to deal with the problems of managing information systems that span autonomous domains. More than 30 researchers participated in a lively and interactive day of paper presentation, panels and software demonstrations. The success of the inaugural event was such that the organizing committee is now committed to running further installations—we are in the process of preparing a submission to run a the 2nd ManFed.CoM in conjunction with the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS) 2012 conference. We believe that these workshops will help to provide the basis for a common understanding and common approaches to inter-domain management and governance that synthesizes the insights and best-of-breed solutions being developed in the diverse areas in which these problems are encountered. The technical program of ManFed.CoM 2011 was organized as a single track and was composed of two panels of invited experts, two full paper sessions, one short paper session and a demonstration session in which practical software tools were presented.

For BPM (Business Process Management) modeling at Fiducia for many years, employees in the business departments have been able to compile large, complex processes by involving experts. Such models are not focused on the point of view of each individual employee involved but on the process as a whole. Consequently, the specification is coarse-grained to such an extent that an identification of the employees with a model and how they effectively work along a process cannot be achieved. Moreover, the superficial examination does not allow deriving guidelines for implementing an IT solution based on coarse-grained models. Introducing S-BPM brings the point of view of the individual employee to the center of describing processes. It thereby enables describing how processes actually run from his/her point of view. We have used this capability to empower the employees of the business departments to carry out this description task (modeling) themselves. Based on a sample project, which also includes integrating SAP as a database, I shall describe the difference between the “traditional” approaches to BPM and S-BPM. Since both approaches were used in this project, the benefits can be described precisely. The savings in Euro and time (earlier availability) represent an important factor here besides the quality of the description. By considering the details of the process, the quality of the description is significantly increased, and, last but not least, the identification of the employees in the business departments with their models, who finally were able to create applications by themselves.','',2,'Lothar Hübner','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1014,'Towards verification of computation orchestration','2014','2',' Orc Web service orchestration Verification Timed automata U ppaal Constraint logic programming CLP \\({(\\mathcal{R})}\\)','Abstract Recently, a promising programming model called Orc has been proposed to support a structured way of orchestrating distributed Web Services. Orc is intuitive because it offers concise constructors to manage concurrent communication, time-outs, priorities, failure of Web Services or communication and so forth. The semantics of Orc is precisely defined. However, there is no automatic verification tool available to verify critical properties against Orc programs. Our goal is to verify the orchestration programs (written in Orc language) which invoke web services to achieve certain goals. To investigate this problem and build useful tools, we explore in two directions. Firstly, we define a Timed Automata semantics for the Orc language, which we prove is semantically equivalent to the operational semantics of Orc. Consequently, Timed Automata models are systematically constructed from Orc programs. The practical implication is that existing tool supports for Timed Automata, e.g., Uppaal, can be used to simulate and model check Orc programs. An experimental tool has been implemented to automate this approach. Secondly, we start with encoding the operational semantics of Orc language in Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), which allows a systematic translation from Orc to CLP. Powerful constraint solvers like CLP \\({(\\mathcal{R})}\\) are then used to prove traditional safety properties and beyond, e.g., reachability, deadlock-freeness, lower or upper bound of a time interval, etc. Counterexamples are generated when properties are not satisfied. Furthermore, the stepwise execution traces can be automatically generated as the simulation steps. The two different approaches give an insight into the verification problem of Web Service orchestration. The Timed Automata approach has its merits in visualized simulation and efficient verification supported by the well developed tools. On the other hand, the CPL approach gives better expressiveness in both modeling and verification. The two approaches complement each other, which gives a complete solution for the simulation and verification of Computation Orchestration.','Formal Aspects of Computing',2,'Jin Song DongYang LiuJun SunXian Zhang','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(1015,'Deriving role engineering artifacts from business processes and scenario models','2011','10','BPMN; RBAC; Role engineering; UML; XMI','Scenario-driven role engineering is a systematic approach to engineer and maintain RBAC models.

According to the orchestration paradigm, the broker coordinates the invocation of services involved in the composition by passing the needed parameters. In general, all previous proposals for the service orchestration model consider the broker as a trusted entity. As such, they never payed attention to the fact that the broker is able to access several pieces of sensitive data. We believe there is the need to protect them against improper access and usage from partner services as well as the broker.

It is essential to identify a group of prosperous collaborative partners in a social network in a prompt and efficient way, especially when the number of alternative service providers is large. However, traditional exhaustive searching approaches are inapplicable in identifying a host enterprise and constitutive members due to the prohibitive computations. In this paper, a new and efficient approach has been proposed to identify service providers optimally based on existing social relations. Three innovations in the proposal are (i) a set of new concepts has been defined to construct a social service provider network; (ii) based on remodeling the social graph, the betweenness centrality algorithm has been enhanced to efficiently find the leader who serves as the host enterprise of a given engineering project; (iii) to improve the efficiency of computation, an innovative algorithm is proposed to identify the collaborative partners by confining the searching space in the set of connector nodes. For the validation purpose, the experimental simulation is conducted and the results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithms outperform several existing algorithms in terms of computation time in dealing with the increasing number of enterprises.','Information Systems Frontiers',1,'Yong SunWenan TanLingxia LiWeiming ShenZhuming BiXiaoming Hu','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(1030,'Taking value-networks to the cloud services: security services, semantics and service level agreements','2013','4',' Security services Trust Collaboration Value networks Resource virtualization Service level agreement Cloud service broker Value chain Web 2.0 Web 3.0','Abstract Cloud services have become an emerging solution for organizations striving to address today’s need for agility, but little research has addressed transitioning multiple, collaborating organizations to what can be referred to as a “value-network cloud.” We know that organizations adopting cloud services to execute business processes must concomitantly reconfigure their security solutions for their integrated intra- and inter-organizational collaborations. We address the question, “What is needed to make it possible for an entire value-network to take secure, collaborative business process executions to the cloud?” Future value-network cloud solutions will require completely new security approaches that will leverage contracted brokering solutions operating as part of the cloud solution. We view value-network cloud security service provisioning as a bundle decision characterized by a mix of communication patterns relevant to intra- and inter-enterprise collaboration. We propose a cloud service broker model—using semantics and SLA based middleware—to serve as a trusted interface between the enterprise, cloud service providers and other organizations collaborating in a value-network.

Some of these employ the Web Service technology, which involves well-defined web technologies and standards that facilitate interoperable machine to machine interaction. Other systems regard services of different technologies (e.g. UPnP, OSGi etc) or generally as abstractions of various actions. Service operations are sometimes implemented as software based functions or actions over hardware equipment (e.g. UPnP players). However, a single service satisfies an atomic only user need, so services need to be composed (i.e. combined), in order to provide the usually requested complex tasks. Since manual service composition is obviously a hassle for the user, ambient systems struggle to automate this process by applying various methods.

This is achieved by creating fault-tolerant composite services that leverage functionally-equivalent services. Three major design issues need to be considered while building software fault-tolerant architectures based on design diversity: (i) selection of variants; (ii) selection of an adjudication algorithm to choose one of the results; and (iii) execution of variants. In addition, applications based on SOA need to function effectively in a dynamic environment where it is necessary to postpone decisions until runtime. In this scenario, control is highly distributed and involves conflicting user requirements. We aim to support the software architect in the design of fault-tolerant compositions. Methods Leveraging a taxonomy for fault-tolerant systems, this paper proposes guidelines to aid software architects in making key design decisions. The taxonomy is used as the basis for defining a set of guidelines to support the architect in making decisions related to fault tolerance in SOA. The same taxonomy is used in a systematic literature review of solutions for fault-tolerant composite services. The review investigates how existing approaches for fault-tolerant composite services address design diversity issues and also specific issues related to SOA. Results The contribution of this work is twofold: (i) a set of guidelines for supporting the design of fault-tolerant SOA, based on a taxonomy for fault tolerance techniques; and (ii) a systematic literature review of existing solutions for designing fault-tolerant compositions using design diversity. Conclusion Although existing solutions have made significant contributions to the development of fault-tolerant SOAs, there is a lack of approaches for fault-tolerant service composition that support strategies with diverse quality requirements and encompassing sophisticated context-aware capabilities. This paper discusses which design issues have been addressed by existing diversity-based approaches for fault-tolerant composite services.

Two research questions are addressed. First, how can we assess quality of QVTo model transformations? Second, how can we develop higher-quality QVTo transformations? To address the first question, we utilize a bottom–up approach, starting with a broad exploratory study including QVTo expert interviews, a review of existing material, and introspection. We then formalize QVTo transformation quality into a QVTo quality model. The quality model is validated through a survey of a broader group of QVTo developers. We find that although many quality properties recognized as important for QVTo do have counterparts in general purpose languages, a number of them are specific to QVTo or model transformation languages. To address the second research question, we leverage the quality model to identify developer support tooling for QVTo. We then implemented and evaluated one of the tools, namely a code test coverage tool. In designing the tool, code coverage criteria for QVTo model transformations are also identified. The primary contributions of this paper are a QVTo quality model relevant to QVTo practitioners and an open-source code coverage tool already usable by QVTo transformation developers.

Though SOA is the driving force for enterprises to open their ends for global business collaborations, nevertheless it evolves many challenges for modeling and enforcing security. One of the main problems for designing secure systems is the lack of consistent frameworks and methodologies for modeling security concerns. Traditional approaches consider security at the end of system development, which evolves inflexible and un-configurable systems, which are too difficult to maintain and manage. The other major problem with current approaches is that they assume pre-defined and hard-coded security patterns and mechanisms for secure system design. Whereas, the evolving SOA systems require configurable security to realize different security patterns and security policies in a variety of business scenarios. To solve these problems, it is necessary to model security concerns from the beginning of system modeling in a platform-independent way. This paper proposes a pattern refinement approach for security modeling to achieve configurable and declarative security, based on the principles of abstraction, refinement, separation-of-concerns and maintainability to achieve flexible configurations of SOA security. In the proposed approach, a Domain Expert defines abstract policies using common security vocabulary and a Security Expert models security with patterns and refines them for a target architecture in successive systematic refinements. Furthermore, it facilitates the transformation of abstract security models into executable security policies for the target platforms.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Mukhtiar MemonGordhan D.

For dealing with dependencies among applications, we present our approach based on services given a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Second, we provide an overview of our design-related controls including a data analytics approach to continuously audit the most critical information assets. Finally, we present our learnings from a first implementation of the presented framework.','',1,'Beat LiverHelmut Kaufmann','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1057,'Security aspects of de-materialized local public administration processes','2015','','Adaptive business processes; BPMN; Local Public Administration','De-materialization processes and services of local public administration processes are becoming of paramount importance in the context of Italian and European public administrations.

Indeed, each service collects road-related information that may be useful to other services. Sharing information collected by each service would allow the acquisition of more knowledge about the driving context that may help drivers making appropriate decisions and, therefore, increase and improve road safety. Recently, wireless communication technologies associated with global navigation satellite systems and location-based information systems are among the powerful technologies used to develop interoperable intelligent transportation systems applications. Furthermore, the evolution of service-oriented infrastructures enables information sharing between applications over the network. In this paper, a distributed platform, called TransportML, for services interaction and cooperation is presented. It is an extended XML platform based on service-oriented architecture principles to recognize, monitor, and collect service information and description over a network. A prototype is developed and tested in urban and highway areas and results are reported to show the benefit of using this platform for sharing road information as well as services’ interactions.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Wafaa Ait-Cheik-BihiAhmed Nait-Sidi-MohMohamed BakhouyaJaafar GaberMaxime Wack','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(1059,'An approach to security-SLA in cloud computing environment','2014','','Cloud Computing Security; Security Management; Security Metrics; Security-SLA','The lack of novel security controls for the cloud might arise from the fact that Cloud Computing is the convergence of many different technological areas, including Utility Computer, Computational Grid, Autonomous Computing, Virtualization and Service Oriented Architectures.

We also noticed a great demand for not only patterns but also specification, monitoring and security management mechanisms for cloud environments. We reason that this scenario might require a different approach, one where the specification of security controls, geared to meet the needs of services users, may be achieved through the use of Security Service Level Agreement - Security-SLA.

These nodes are distributed across the environment and they send the outcome of events that occur in nature. In this network each node has to send a request/response to a Base Node (BN) where all requests/responses are evaluated and the required values are computed for the end user. This activity requires middleware service oriented architecture, Image Processing and Video Processing. Hence this network is fully dependent on the services of middleware in WSNs. The noticeable outcome values or flags are passed on to a special system called Rescue and Crime Information System (RCIS) where all filtered and computed values or flags are displayed in this system with severity of events and required information. The proposed architecture provides universal solutions for most of the natural disasters and criminal activities that occur frequently. Hence this information provided by the RCIS is very essential and effective in handling disasters and crimes.','',1,'N. ChandrakantA. P. BijilP. Deepa ShenoyK. R. VenugopalL. M.

Services in cloud computing are offered at relatively low cost. The model, therefore, forms a great target for many applications, such as startup businesses and e-commerce applications. The area of cloud computing has grown rapidly in the last few years; yet, it still faces some obstacles. For example, there is a lack of mechanisms that guarantee for cloud users the quality that they are actually getting, compared to the quality of service that is specified in SLAs. Another example is the concern of security, privacy and trust, since users lose control over their data and programs once they are sent to cloud providers. In this paper, we introduce a new architecture that aids the design and implementation of attestation services. The services monitor cloud-based applications to ensure software quality, such as security, privacy, trust and usability of cloud-based applications. Our approach is a user-centric approach through which users have more control on their own data/applications. Further, the proposed approach is a cloud-based approach where the powers of the clouds are utilized.

Some concerns cross over several business processes (known as cross-cutting concerns), and they hinder current modularization techniques to encapsulate them efficiently. Aspect Oriented Business Process Modelling aims to encapsulate these concerns from business process models. Although many researchers proposed different aspect-oriented business process modelling approaches, there is no analysis technique to check these models in terms of soundness. Thus, this paper proposes a formal definitions and semantics for aspect-oriented business process models, and it enables the analysis of these models in terms of soundness at design time through defining a static weaving algorithm. The algorithm is implemented as an artefact that support weaving aspect-oriented business process models. The artefact is used to analyse different scenarios, and the result of analysis reveals the situations that can introduce different problems like deadlock. In addition, an example of such scenario is given that shows how the artefact can detect the problems at design time. Such analysis enables process modellers to discover the problems at design time, so the problems will not be left to be discovered at runtime - which apply a lot of costs to correct them.','',2,'Amin Jalali','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1082,'An Emulated Test Framework for Service Discovery and MANET Research Based on ns-3','2012','5','','In this paper we present our framework for emulated evaluation of service discovery protocols in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs).

SLA definition and monitoring are open issues within the ITSM domain. This paper overviews an ongoing research initiative concerned with three specific problems in this context: (1) SLAs in the context of ITSM are informally specified in natural language, (2) SLAs specifications are not grounded on models of ITSM processes, (3) SLAs compliance verification in IT services is not performed at the same level of abstraction as service design. To mitigate those problems, we propose a model-based approach to IT services SLA specification and compliance verification. The specification part will be based on a SLA language - a domain specific language (DSL) for defining quality attributes as non functional requirements (NFRs) in the context of ITSM. Its metamodel will be an extension of the metamodel of the adopted process modeling language. As such, it will be possible to ground SLA definition on the corresponding IT service model constructs.

An adaptation activates multiple features in the system, according to the current execution context ( e . g ., CPU consumption, available bandwidth). However, the underlying approaches used to implement adaptation are ordered, e . g . the order in which a set of features are turned on or off matters. Assuming feature definition as etched in stone, the identification of the right sequence is a difficult and time–consuming problem. We propose here a composition operator that intrinsically supports the commutativity of adaptations. Using this operator, one can minimize the number of ordered compositions in a system. It relies on an action–based approach, as this representation can support preexisting composition operators as well as our contribution in an uniform way. This approach is validated on the Service–Oriented Architecture domain, and is implemented using first–order logic.','',1,'Sébastien MosserMireille Blay-FornarinoLaurence Duchien','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1088,'Behavioral Consistency Measurement and Analysis of WS-BPEL Processes','2013','0',' BPEL Processes Behavioral Consistency Process Alignment BPEL Program Dependence Graph','Abstract With the development of services and cloud computing, service-based business processes (e.g., WS-BPEL processes) are paid more attention by practitioners.

Over the years, some templates (in the form of concepts relating the WHO, WHAT and WHY dimensions into a phrase) have been proposed by agile methods practitioners or academics to guide requirements gathering. Using these templates can be problematic. Indeed, none of them define any semantic related to a particular syntax precisely or formally leading to various possible interpretations of the concepts. Consequently, these templates are used in an ad–hoc manner, each modeler having idiosyncratic preferences. This can nevertheless lead to an underuse of representation mechanisms, misunderstanding of a concept use and poor communication between stakeholders.

Although WSN network management techniques have been recently proposed, these techniques lack a complete architecture and integrated design for their external interface. In addition, future WSNs may be composed of heterogeneous sensor devices and may use a large number of applications cooperatively. Traditional network management techniques will not meet the resulting requirements. Recent advances in cloud computing and in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) provide exciting opportunities for solving this challenge. However, current implementations of cloud computing infrastructures are often isolated from others. To better support the multi-tenancy feature of cloud computing, this paper proposes a Service-Oriented Cloud Computing Network Management Architecture for WSNs (SCNA-WSN) to adopt an SOA and to provide web services for integrating heterogeneous cloud computing infrastructures. In SCNA-WSN, users access each resource as a service, eliminating the need to own the physical infrastructure, platform, or software. External applications can use web services to integrate SCNA-WSN. As a result, users can integrate and use various network management resources depending on system requirements. To protect service privacy and to preserve service scalability, an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) security mechanism and a multicast overlay network are provided in the proposed SCNA-WSN. The proposed architecture is effective and secure. This architecture can provide sensor services with ubiquity, scalability and reliability. In this paper, we provide not only the theoretic analysis but also the implementation of an example system to demonstrate that an SCNA-WSN can decrease the difficulty of integrating different cloud platforms and heterogeneous sensor devices.

This approach allows consumers to maintain a trust model for each service provider they interact with, leading to the prediction of the most trustworthy service a consumer can interact with among a plethora of similar services. In this paper, we associate the trust in a service to its performance denoted by QoS ratings instigated by the amalgamation of various QoS metrics. Since the quality of a service is contingent, which renders its trustworthiness uncertain, we adopt a probabilistic approach for the prediction of the quality of a service based on the evaluation of past experiences (ratings) of each of its consumers. We represent the QoS ratings of services using different statistical distributions, namely multinomial Dirichlet, multinomial generalized Dirichlet, and multinomial Beta-Liouville. We leverage various machine learning techniques to compute the probabilities of each web service to belong to different quality classes. For instance, we use the Bayesian inference method to estimate the parameters of the aforementioned distributions, which presents a multidimensional probabilistic embodiment of the quality of the corresponding web services. We also employ a Bayesian network classifier with a Beta-Liouville prior to enable the classification of the QoS of composite services given the QoS of its constituents. We extend our approach to function in an online setting using the Voting EM algorithm that enables the estimation of the probabilities of the QoS after each interaction with a web service.

This hides all of the details underlying XML and HTTP while still leaving the user with a lot of flexibility and control. In this chapter, we describe how to access SOAP Web services from within R and how to generate the interfaces from WSDL documents describing the service’s methods and data structures.

Focusing solely on IT service management and ignoring service governance aspects may cause difficulties in measuring the performance of service management, defining and deploying the roles and responsibilities of service management, allocating the resources for right service improvements and adopting the service-oriented process culture. The research problem of this study is: How does IT service management differ from IT service governance? The main contribution of the study is a framework for IT service governance and a roadmap of IT service management frameworks and standards that can be utilized in establishing IT service governance activities. The theory-based framework is validated in an IT service change management case study with five Finnish IT service provider organizations.

Thus, we conducted a descriptive survey to explore how QA are treated during the architecting of SBS. Data were collected using an online questionnaire targeted at participants with architecting experience. Our survey shows that QA and functional requirements of SBS are mostly considered equally important. Also, QA are usually treated explicitly rather than implicitly. Furthermore, dependability and performance appear to be the most important QA in the context of SBS. Our results partially show that general findings on QA also apply to the domain of SBS. On the other hand, we did not find a confirmation that QA are primary drivers for the architecting of SBS, or that certain application domains would focus on particular QA.','',1,'David AmellerMatthias GalsterParis AvgeriouXavier Franch','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1121,'Traffic Pattern Analysis for Distributed Anomaly Detection','2012','0',' Service Oriented Architecture Security Anomaly Detection','Abstract Network anomalies refer to situations when observed network traffic deviate from normal network behaviour.

This is why; the success of semantic web depends on the proliferation of ontologies. Depending on the nature of the application, different companies may use different ontology languages and QoS models for web services selection which lead to the issue of heterogeneity.

The produced models tend to be large and complex, especially in flexible environments where process executions involve multiple alternatives. This overload of information is caused by the fact that traditional discovery techniques construct procedural models explicitly showing all possible behaviours. Moreover, existing techniques offer limited possibilities to guide the mining process towards specific properties of interest. These problems can be solved by discovering declarative models. Using a declarative model, the discovered process behaviour is described as a (compact) set of rules. Moreover, the discovery of such models can easily be guided in terms of rule templates.

Recent standardization of Business Process Model and Notation version 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) provides a way to support inter-operation of business processes at user level, rather than at the software engine level. Wide adoption of the BPMN 2.0 standard is limited by the lack of runtimes natively supporting BPMN 2.0.

While there is no doubt that the emergence of modern M&S is highly connected with that of Computing and Systems science, there is no clear evidence of the contribution of M&S to those disciplines. Further, while there is a growing body of knowledge (BoK) in M&S, there is no easy way to identify it due to the multidisciplinary nature of M&S. In this paper, we examine whether M&S is its own discipline by performing content analysis of a BoK in Computer Science. Content analysis is a research methodology that aims to identify key concepts and relationships in a body of text through computational means. It can be applied to research articles in a BoK to identify the prominent topics and themes. It can also be used to explore the evolution of a BoK over time or to identify the contribution of one BoK to another. The contribution of this paper is twofold; (1) the establishment of M&S as its own discipline and the examination of its relationship with the sister disciplines of Computer Science and Systems Engineering over the last 60 years and (2) the examination of the contribution of M&S to the sciences as represented in the Public Library of Science.','Scientometrics',1,'Saikou Y.

However, the crosscutting nature of such concerns leads to complex, scattered, and tangled models that are hard to understand and to manage. The lack of appropriate means to modularize crosscutting concerns in business process modeling languages seriously affects understandability, maintainability and reusability. In a previous work we proposed AO4BPMN 1.0 as an aspect-oriented extension of BPMN that allows the modularization of crosscutting concerns. However, there were several open issues in that proposal. First, it lacks a concrete weaving mechanism for composing business processes and aspects. Second, it lacks a well-defined pointcut language to select join points. Third, it does not support BPMN 2.0, which was still under development at that time. In this paper we tackle these issues and present a weaver for AO4BPMN based on model transformation as well as an OCL-based pointcut language.','',2,'Heiko WitteborgAnis CharfiDaniel Colomer CollellMira Mezini','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(1162,'Hypervisor Event Logs as a Source of Consistent Virtual Machine Evidence for Forensic Cloud Investigations','2013','4','','Abstract Cloud Computing is an emerging model of computing where users can leverage the computing infrastructure as a service stack or commodity.

Typically security monitoring is used to firstly determine if the system corresponds to the specifications in these models and secondly to deal with threats, e.g. by detecting intrusions, via monitoring rules. The challenge of security monitoring stems mainly from two aspects. First, information in form of models needs to be integrated in the analysis part, e.g. rule creation, visualization, such that the plethora of monitored events are analyzed and represented in a meaningful manner. Second, new intrusion types are basically invisible to established monitoring techniques such as signature-based methods and supervised learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a pluggable monitoring framework that focuses on the above two issues by linking event information and modelling specification to perform compliance detection and anomaly detection. As input the framework leverages models that define workflows, event information, as well as the underlying network infrastructure. Assuming that new intrusions manifest in anomalous behaviour which cannot be foreseen, we make use of a popular unsupervised machine-learning technique called clustering.','',2,'Matthias GanderBasel KattMichael FeldererRuth Breu','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1169,'3rd Workshop on Smart Surveillance System Applications','2012','0','','','',1,'Iosif Viorel Onut','acm/service oriented architecture security.csv','acm','\0'),(1170,'The Safety-Critical Java memory model formalised','2013','1',' Safety-Critical Java Memory safety Semantics Unifying theories of programming Integration Refinement','Abstract Safety-Critical Java (SCJ) is a version of Java for real-time programming, restricted to facilitate certification of implementations of safety-critical systems.

Embedded control software deals with controlling a physical system, and as such models of physical characteristics become part of the embedded control software. In current practices, usually general-purpose languages (GPL), such as C/C++ are used for embedded systems development. Although a GPL is suitable for expressing general-purpose computation, it falls short in expressing the models of physical characteristics as desired. This reduces not only the readability of the code but also hampers reuse due to the lack of dedicated abstractions and composition operators. Moreover, domain-specific static and dynamic checks may not be applied effectively. There exist domain-specific modeling languages (DSML) and tools to specify models of physical characteristics. Although they are commonly used for simulation and documentation of physical systems, they are often not used to implement embedded control software. This is due to the fact that these DSMLs are not suitable to express the general-purpose computation and they cannot be easily composed with other software modules that are implemented in GPL. This paper presents a novel approach to combine a DSML to model physical characteristics and a GPL to implement general-purpose computation. The composition filters model is used to compose models specified in the DSML with modules specified in the GPL at the abstraction level of both languages. As such, this approach combines the benefits of using a DSML to model physical characteristics with the freedom of a GPL to implement general-purpose computation. The approach is illustrated using two industrial case studies from the printing systems domain.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Arjan de RooHasan SözerMehmet Akşit','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(1177,'Analysis on countering XML-based attacks in web services','2013','6','Cloud computing; Service oriented architecture; SOAP; Web services security; XML security','Cloud Computing is found to be today\'s most commonly used Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) implementation.

The speed of change in Internet Technologies continues to be impressive and the current “Future Internet” based society increasingly relies on software at all levels. Nevertheless, software systems continue to suffer from aging symptoms caused by the inherent factors of the software modernization process: inevitable; unpredictable; costly; difficult; time- and resource-consuming; poorly supported by tools, techniques or formalisms; poorly understood and maintained; undervalued in traditional software development processes, etc. Furthermore, current technological and business innovations (such as Cloud Computing and Software as a Service (SaaS) concepts) are changing the way in which software is designed, developed, tested, delivered and consumed. All this means that new requirements, never seen before in software development, have to be faced (scalability, multi-tenancy support, usage monitoring, security, SLA compliance, etc.). These challenges are even greater when adapting previously developed software to this new landscape. Different approaches (reverse engineering, ADM, or service-oriented-architecture modernization) have to be analyzed depending on the source language, architecture, target market or available resources. As a result, the complete software life cycle, from requirements to runtime and delivery, has to be re-adapted to the new technological and business conditions, needs and challenges, thus increasing the need of advanced means to support software evolution and adaptation as a key value for the next-generation service-based software modernization. One particular example of complex system modernization is the exposure of legacy systems as SaaS. Model-driven techniques have been used for several years to cope with the challenge of transformation of legacy systems as SaaS. Regardless of the positive features of these techniques, for legacy systems there are many challenges such as are the availability of arc- itectural models describing the system (typically unavailable for legacy systems), the ability to transform the original system into new ones compatible with targeted infrastructures and frameworks, and the support for adaptive deployment. All these features are particular relevant when deploying legacy applications as SaaS on the Web, for instance using different Cloud offerings. Desirable solutions are those that can automate the transformation of existing legacy systems that require being transformed into modern ones exposed as services (SaaS) compatible with modern technology frameworks. This keynote will present the challenges and needs, as well as the results obtained so far in this novel architecture and business model based on the cloud.','2012 IEEE 6th International Workshop on the Maintenance and Evolution of Service-Oriented and Cloud-Based Systems (MESOCA)',1,'L.

Generation of stable and tunable mm-wave and THz signals is extremely attractive for applications including tomography, gas sensing and imaging for security systems. Currently photonic methods for generating signals at these frequencies show either very limited tunability, as in the case of passively mode-locked lasers and THz quantum cascade lasers , or poor spectral purity, evinced in the photomixing of two uncorrelated laser sources. In addition, current systems using the combination of a number of discrete optical elements require the use of bulky alignment optics increasing packaging costs and sensitivity to environmental noise sources. In this work a relatively simple arrangement of three DFB laser sources on a single chip is proposed and demonstrated, a schematic of the scheme is shown in Fig. 1(a). Two lasers DFB1 and DFB2 inject into DFB3 whose free running frequency is designed to emit between those of DFB. The result is that Four Wave Mixing (FWM) products of the pairs of lasers DFB and DFB are produced within DFB. These FWM signals then produce feedback signals that coincide in frequency with the complimentary laser source, i.e. the laser pair DFB produce a FWM product equal in frequency to DFB, thus locking their phases and stabilising the optical beating signal. Furthermore, by simply tuning the frequency spacing of DFB and DFB, ensuring that DFB tracks their centre point, the generated beating signal can be continuously tuned over a wide frequency range. This scheme was fabricated on a multi-quantum well AlGaInAsInP material system and the DFB lasers were defined using upper-cladding sidewall modulation gratings in order to generate precise spacing of the three laser wavelengths [3]. Tuning of the laser wavelengths was achieved by direct current injection variation, with integrated SOA sections ensuring the optimal injection amplitude range was maintained. Measurements of the RF signal generated by the beating signal from th- output at DFB show a linewidth reduction of an order of magnitude (to 2.5MHz) when the system is in the phase locked condition. Locking range measurements show a tolerance of ~2GHz on the position of the wavelength of DFB. Furthermore, the locked frequency can be tuned continuously from a few GHz to 40GHz (the maximum measureable frequency of our RF spectrum analyser) as shown in Fig.1 (b).','Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe (CLEO EUROPE/IQEC), 2013 Conference on and International Quantum Electronics Conference',1,'M.

A major shortcoming of the analysis techniques is that they solely focus on the control-flow dimension of the process, omitting how business objects (i.e., cases) and their data affect and are manipulated by process instances and their tasks. In this work, we aim at filling this gap. We recast the classical notion of case-centric business process in a data-aware context. An emitter action is used to generate new cases, and while a case flows through the process control-flow, corresponding data are created, updated, and deleted by operating over a full-fledged relational database with constraints. To make our investigation concrete, we ground it on the recently introduced framework of data-centric dynamic systems (DCDSs). We reformulate the standard correctness criterion of soundness into this rich setting, and show that it is in general undecidable to check. We then provide a fine-grained analysis on the role of data in business processes. We substantiate this analysis by introducing a class of case-centric DCDSs that enjoys good modeling principles, and at the same time guarantees decidability of soundness. Decidability is obtained by finding a cutoff on the number of process instances that must be subject to the soundness test. We finally show that the introduced modeling guidelines are strict, in the sense that weakening even one single requirement they pose leads to undecidability.','International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer',2,'Marco MontaliDiego Calvanese','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1184,'Anonymity of web service invocations','2014','','','Service Oriented Architectures offer modularity and flexibility, while maintaining a relatively simple communication model. Security is still needed as messages can be intercepted by a potential attacker and the service interaction can be compromised. One research direction to achieve this is to hide the identity of the communication parties by assuring sender and receiver anonymity and by protecting the message content through encryption. This paper describes a solution to ensure anonymous web service access through the use of a proxy-based system. This solution protects the identity of a set of web services by mediating all web service invocation requests and imposing a set of security policies. Since the proxy manages multiple web service instances deployed on multiple devices, it also implements a set of load balancing policies, which help improve performance and prevent overloading. We tested the proposed solution and analyzed the overhead introduced by the proxy within the web service invocation process. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the overhead introduced by the additional security features. © 2014 IEEE.','',1,'Davidoaia B., Leordeanu C., Cristea V.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1185,'An Efficient Optimization Algorithm of Autonomic Managers in Service-Based Applications','2015','0',' Cloud computing Autonomic managers Service-based applications Optimization','Abstract Cloud Computing is an emerging paradigm in Information Technologies that enables the delivery of infrastructure, software and platform resources as services.

Meanwhile, optimization of autonomic managers remains not well explored. In fact, almost all the existing solutions on autonomic computing have been interested in modeling and implementing of autonomic environments without paying attention on optimization. In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm to optimize autonomic managers for the management of service-based applications. Our algorithm allows to determine the minimum number of autonomic managers and to assign them to services that compose managed service-based applications.

These applications have to adapt quickly to the diversified and dynamic changing requirements in the physical, technological, economical and social environments.

Although the relevance of securing a technology as crucial to the Internet as DNS is obvious, the DNSSEC implementation increases the complexity of the deployed DNS infrastructure, which may result in misconfiguration. In this article, we measure and analyze the misconfigurations for domains in six zones (.bg, .br, .co, .com, .nl and .se). Furthermore, we categorize these misconfigurations and provide an explanation for their possible causes. Finally, we evaluate the effects of misconfigurations on the reachability of a zone’s network. Our results show that, although progress has been made in the implementation of DNSSEC, over 4 % of evaluated domains show misconfigurations. The domains with the most frequently appearing misconfiguration are often hosted at a very limited set of hosting providers. Of these misconfigured domains, almost 75 % were unreachable from a DNSSEC-aware resolver. This illustrates that although the authorities of a domain may think their DNS is secured, it is in fact not. Worse still, misconfigured domains are at risk of being unreachable from the clients who care about and implement DNSSEC verification, while the publisher may remain unaware of the error and its consequences.','Security Informatics',1,'Niels L.

The chief contribution of this work resides in autonomously selecting the optimal set of composite service components sustaining the most efficient energy consumption characteristics among a set of providers for executing a particular service request. For ensuring the accountability of the system, the routing decision engine is designed to operate by processing accountable energy measurements extracted securely from within the cloud data centers using trusted computing technologies and cryptographic mechanisms. By pushing green computing constraints into the service routing decision engine, we can leverage the collaborative cloud computing model to maximize the energy savings achieved. This is realized by focusing on a path of providers that execute the service requests instead of directing the green computing efforts towards a single provider site. To the best of our knowledge, G-Route is the first service routing protocol that utilizes the collaborative properties among cloud providers to select “green” service routes and thus, to enhance the energy savings in the overall cloud computing infrastructure . The devised G-Route design is developed and deployed in a real cloud computing environment using the Amazon EC2 cloud platform. The experimental results obtained analyze the protocol convergence characteristics, traffic overhead, and resilience under anomalous service configurations and conditions and demonstrate the capability of the proposed system to significantly reduce the overall energy requirements of collaborative cloud services.','Cluster Computing',1,'Wassim ItaniCesar GhaliAyman KayssiAli ChehabImad Elhajj','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(1190,'Transformation challenges: from software models to performance models','2014','3',' Software performance Performance analysis Model transformation UML MARTE profile Layered queueing networks','Abstract A software model can be analysed for non-functional requirements by extending it with suitable annotations and transforming it into analysis models for the corresponding non-functional properties. For quantitative performance evaluation, suitable annotations are standardized in the “UML Profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded systems” (MARTE) and its predecessor, the “UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance and Time”. A range of different performance model types (such as queueing networks, Petri nets, stochastic process algebra) may be used for analysis. In this work, an intermediate “Core Scenario Model” (CSM) is used in the transformation from the source software model to the target performance model. CSM focuses on how the system behaviour uses the system resources. The semantic gap between the software model and the performance model must be bridged by (1) information supplied in the performance annotations, (2) in interpretation of the global behaviour expressed in the CSM and (3) in the process of constructing the performance model. Flexibility is required for specifying sets of alternative cases, for choosing where this bridging information is supplied, and for overriding values. It is also essential to be able to trace the source of values used in a particular performance estimate. The performance model in turn can be used to verify responsiveness and scalability of a software system, to discover architectural limitations at an early stage of development, and to develop efficient performance tests. This paper describes how the semantic gap between software models in UML+MARTE and performance models (based on queueing or Petri nets) can be bridged using transformations based on CSMs, and how the transformation challenges are addressed.','Software & Systems Modeling',1,'Murray WoodsideDorina C.

This study has used group interviews to explore how different temporal aspects of CM can be considered in CM design and how they can influence crisis managers SA. A prototype and a scenario were used as mediating materials. The result consists of two parts. The first part is comprised of the participants’ reflections on how timelines can be used to display information in CM information systems. According to the participants, timelines should present: deadlines, information sent to the public, incoming and outgoing information, an overview of where the current activities belong in the CM process and what has been going on since the last shift during shift changes. Timelines should not only display the listed information, but also provide functionality for adjusting the timescale so that information can be presented in alternative temporal perspectives. The second part of the result contains several obstacles that might influence the crisis managers’ ability to obtain SA. Obstacles elicited from the group discussions are: information overflow, fast changes of SA due to incoming information, difficulties to share SA with actors outside the CM centre, forgetting things that need attention and that SA depends on the quality of incoming information.

Service oriented architecture (SOA), and more specifically Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi), has emerged to be one of the most suitable choices; however, our experience using OSGi exposes its several shortcomings as an SOA platform: 1. The number of services required to be designed and implemented for each sensor, actuator and external system can be prohibitively high; 2. Cross-architecture interaction with non-OSGi software artifacts is challenging and inelegant; 3. There is a need for a more systematic approach to allow mobile devices remote access to OSGi services and enable opportunistic utilizations of local resources. We propose a framework to address these challenges by introducing a mechanism to support morphing a core service implementation of underlying communication protocols and software libraries to customized services using configuration files and a cross-architecture service directory for both OSGi and web services (WS). Our solution allows mobile devices to discover, access and adjust for local resources and results in more open, less cumbersome, and more integrative interactions among computing, communicative, sensing and actuation elements in smart environments.','',2,'Hen-I YangRyan BabbittJohnny WongCarl K.

Towards this objective, we propose a collaborative autonomic management of component-based applications in distributed environments.

An AM is able to collaborate with other managers in different hierarchical levels for the self-management of the whole application.

Service discovery is an important component of IPTV system, but it is challenging due to the unique domain specifics of IPTV and complexities of IPTV ecosystem. In this paper, we formulate the IPTV service discovery problem under an SOA framework, and propose a novel standards-based semantic IPTV service discovery system. The proposed system is based on unifying the traditionally step-wise iterative process of IPTV service discovery, and a semantic integration of service provider and IPTV service descriptions. For demonstration, we consider a specific discovery scenario involving service providers that offer a combination of standard TV services such as linear TV and VoD content, and also advanced interactive multimedia-based IPTV services. With detailed illustration, we demonstrate that our proposed system provides simple but effective discovery of IPTV services, and possesses several benefits that can potentially enhance end-user experience.','2012 IEEE Eighth World Congress on Services',1,'F.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) based modeling technique to construct service compositions. The successful compositions created for the given application are treated as statements belonging to an efficient composition PCFG of this application. The given set of such compositions is used to derive this PCFG automatically. Future composition could be then easily constructed with the help of such PCFG. We present our methodology for achieving such modeling and provide examples of its use to demonstrate its advantage over previous work.

However, in order to fulfill the security requirements, technical security controls or mechanisms have to be considered and deployed on the target system. Based on these security controls security patterns have to be selected. The MDS (Model Driven Security) approach uses security requirement models at a high level of abstraction to automatically generate security artefacts that configure security services. The main drawback of the current MDS solutions is that they consider just one security pattern for each security requirement. Current SOA and cloud services are scattered across multiple heterogeneous security domains. Partners and clients with different security infrastructures are changing continuously, which requires the support of multiple patterns for the same security service. The challenge is to provide configurable security services that can support different patterns. In order to overcome this shortcoming we propose a framework that integrates pattern refinement to the MDS approach. In this approach a security pattern refinement layer is added to the traditional MDS layers. The pattern refinement layer supports the configuration of one security service with different patterns, which are stored in a pattern catalog. For example, our approach enables the generation of security artefacts that configure a non-repudiation service to support both fair non-repudiation and naive non-repudiation patterns. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.','',1,'Katt B., Gander M., Breu R., Felderer M.','scopus/soa security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1214,'ACaaS: Access control as a service for IaaS cloud','2013','','Access control; Cloud computing; Security','Organizations and enterprises have been outsourcing their computation, storage, and workflows to Infrastructureas-a-Service (IaaS) based cloud platforms.

Later, when applications evolved integrating heterogeneous devices, it rendered difficulty in enforcing a common standard among all the diverse devices. In order to handle this, a lot of WSN middleware platforms emerged to bind the application interaction with the heterogeneous devices through heterogeneous interfaces. This started increasing the service-based applications while decreasing the device-based applications. Apart from not only providing the classic task of reading the information from the sensor network, the middleware support were extended to address interoperability, management, security, and privacy. However, still there exists an important issue, which many of the existing middleware fail to address. For instance, the network design scenario varies depending on the application context. However, most of the existing middleware operate on the default network infrastructure and data dissemination protocol to collect the data and perform other tasks on the network. Therefore, there is a requirement to include support for customizing the network configuration for an application requirement with respect to its context. Hence, in this work, a service provisioning middleware based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) is proposed. To support network customization, in the middleware layer, a decision algorithm is proposed. It is used for generating the configuration file according to the application requirement. This service provisioning middleware would serve as a generic model for adapting to the required network environment. © Springer India 2016.','',1,'Sasirekha S., Swamynathan S.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus',''),(1218,'The integration of an RE method and AHP: A pilot study in a large Swiss bank','2013','0','Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP);Banking;Requirements Engineering;SEAM;Service Oriented Architecture (SOA);Switzerland','This paper reports on a pilot study of the integration between the Systemic Enterprise Architecture Method (SEAM) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in a requirements engineering project.

The traditional approach in the hydrologic sciences and engineering fields has been to either treat the atmosphere as a forcing condition on the hydrologic model, or to adopt a specific hydrologic model design in order to be interoperable with a climate model. We propose here a different approach that follows a service-oriented architecture and uses standard interfaces and tools: the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) from the weather and climate community and the Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI) from the hydrologic community. A novel technical challenge of this work is that the climate model runs on a high performance computer and the hydrologic model runs on a personal computer. In order to complete a two-way coupling, issues with security and job scheduling had to be overcome. The resulting application demonstrates interoperability across disciplinary boundaries and has the potential to address emerging questions about climate impacts on local water resource systems. The approach also has the potential to be adapted for other climate impacts applications that involve different communities, multiple frameworks, and models running on different computing platforms.

The most compatible and interoperable handover management solutions are designed based on IP mobility protocols. However, due to the unique characteristics of vehicles such as high velocity, IP mobility management protocols are still unacceptable for ITS real-time applications that are sensitive to network latencies. Thus, whenever the vehicle roams between two domains, which is most likely to occur in vehicular networks, its reachability status will be broken-down causing high handover latency and inevitable traffic loss. Recently, proxy mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) has been proposed to support the mobility management without any intervention of the mobile user in the mobility-related signaling. As PMIPv6 will be deployed in the wireless technologies for next generation networks (i.e., LTE/LTE-advanced, WiFi and WiMAX), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are expected to employ PMIPv6 protocol in vehicle to infrastructure connection as well. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive review of the state of the art of PMIPv6 handover management in VANET.

The global security requirements are represented in a separate XML-based descriptor document. The local behavior for the individual business partners can be generated from the WS-CDL specification using the abstract Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL). WS-BPEL is used in this step solely to describe externally observable message exchange behavior of each business partner involved, without revealing their internal implementation.

The k-means segmentation is used to extract board area and then connected component technique helps refill the board area which is covered by lecturer’s body. Then we use adaptive threshold to extract handwritings in various light conditions and time-series denoising technique is designed to reduce noise. According to extracted handwritings, the lecture videos can be automatically structured with high level of semantics. The lecture videos are segmented into video clips and all key-frames are integrated as handouts of the education videos.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',1,'Greg C.

Diversity and heterogeneity of these services raise many needs for the integration. To meet these needs, the Enterprise Service Bus has been proposed for the development of standard based collaborative strategies between services and applications. However the lack of semantic, the competitiveness between services and the dynamicity of service-oriented architectures contexts (mobility, increase of consumers and providers of services, etc.) are the reason of unpredictable events such as service unavailability, high overhead and response time, decrease of reliability, security, etc. Those events ask to adapt the established integration strategies to ensure or improve performance and Quality of Service offered by the Enterprise Service Bus. In this context, we propose a QoS-aware and ontology-driven Autonomic Service Bus able to take into account non functional properties\' semantics in order to offer self-configuration and self-adaptation functionalities. Beyond the traditional objectives of enterprise service buses, our proposal includes the use of well known transport and network mechanisms to take into account autonomously both functional and non functional properties asked or offered by services consumers or providers.','Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE), 2012 IEEE 21st International Workshop on',1,'C.

For example, state machines can be used to model software behavior when hardware (e.g., sensors) breaks down and be fed to a tool to automate test case generation. But robustness behavior is a crosscutting behavior and, if modeled directly, often results in large, complex state machines. These in practice tend to be error prone and difficult to read and understand. As a result, modeling robustness behavior in this way is not scalable for complex industrial systems. To overcome these problems, aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) can be employed to model robustness behavior as aspects in the form of state machines specifically designed to model robustness behavior. In this paper, we present a RobUstness Modeling Methodology (RUMM) that allows modeling robustness behavior as aspects. Our goal is to have a complete and practical methodology that covers all features of state machines and aspect concepts necessary for model-based robustness testing. At the core of RUMM is a UML profile (AspectSM) that allows modeling UML state machine aspects as UML state machines (aspect state machines). Such an approach, relying on a standard and using the target notation as the basis to model the aspects themselves, is expected to make the practical adoption of aspect modeling easier in industrial contexts. We have used AspectSM to model the crosscutting robustness behavior of a videoconferencing system and discuss the benefits of doing so in terms of reduced modeling effort and improved readability.','Software & Systems Modeling',1,'Shaukat AliLionel C.

In many applications, it is important that maximum interoperability is enabled.

In this paper we describe an approach where we model composite services and threats together, which allows us to create preventive measures at design-time. At runtime, our specification also allows the service runtime environment (SRE) to receive alerts about active threats that we have not handled, and react to these automatically through adaptation of the composite service. A goal-oriented security requirements modelling tool is used to model business-level threats and analyse how they may impact goals. A process flow modelling tool, utilising Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and standard error boundary events, allows us to define how threats should be responded to during service execution on a technical level. Throughout the software life-cycle, we maintain threats in a centralised threat repository. Re-use of these threats extends further into monitoring alerts being distributed through a cloud-based messaging service.

This is evidenced by the growing number of publications on the topic. The literature offers numerous quality frameworks for addressing SPI practices, which may be classified into two groups: ones that describe “what” should be done (ISO 9001, CMMI) and ones that describe “how” it should be done (Six Sigma, Goal Question Metrics-GQM). When organizations decide to adopt improvement initiatives, many models may be implied, each leveraging the best practices provided, in the quest to address the improvement challenges as well as possible. This may at the same time, however, generate confusion and overlapping activities, as well as extra effort and cost. That, in turn, risks generating a series of inefficiencies and redundancies that end up leading to losses rather than to effective process improvement. Consequently, it is important to move toward a harmonization of quality frameworks, aiming to identify intersections and overlapping parts, as well as to create a multi-model improvement solution. Our aim in this work is twofold: first of all, we propose a theoretical harmonization process that supports organizations interested in introducing quality management and software development practices or concerned about improving those they already have.

A service developer plays the role that is responsible for constructing service compositions and the service provider is responsible for offering them to consumers of the Aniketos platform. Typically, service consumers will have different needs and requirements; they have varying business goals and different expectations from a service, for example in terms of functionality, quality of service and security needs. Given this, it is important to ensure that a service should deliver for which it has been selected and should match the consumer’s expectations. If it fails, the system should take appropriate subsequent reactions, e.g., notifications to the service consumer or service designer.In this chapter, we present the policy-driven monitoring framework which is developed as part of the Aniketos project. The monitoring framework allows different user-specified policies to be monitored simultaneously. The monitoring is performed at the business level, as well as at the implementation level, which allows for checking the policies of composite services as well as atomic ones. The framework sends an alarm in case of policy violation to notify the interested parties and triggers re-composition or re-configuration of the service. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.','',2,'Asim M., Yautsiukhin A., Brucker A.D., Lempereur B., Shi Q.','scopus/bpmn security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1270,'Managing Clouds, Smart Networks and Services: A Report on APNOMS 2011','2012','3',' Network operations and management Management of clouds Smart networks and services','Abstract This article presents a report on APNOMS 2011, which was held September 21–23, 2011 in Taipei, Taiwan.

Therefore, the need for the new access control frameworks to link their decision making abilities with the context-awareness capabilities have become increasingly significant. The main goal of this research is to develop a new access control framework that is capable of providing secure access to information resources or software services in a context-aware manner. Towards this goal, we propose a new semantic policy framework that extends the basic role-based access control (RBAC) approach with both dynamic associations of user-role and role-service capabilities. We also introduce a context model in modelling the basic and high-level context information relevant to access control. In addition, a situation can be determined on the fly so as to combine the relevant states of the entities and the purpose or user’s intention in accessing the services. For this purpose, we can propose a situation model in modelling the purpose-oriented situations. Finally we need a policy model that will let the users to access resources or services when certain dynamically changing conditions (using context and situation information) are satisfied.','',1,'A.

Insight in time-dependent behaviors of attacks and the evolution of the attacker’s success as time progresses is therefore a key for effective countermeasures in securing systems. This paper presents an efficient technique to analyze attack times for an extension of the prominent formalism of attack trees. If each basic attack step, i.e. , each leaf in an attack tree, is annotated with a probability distribution of the time needed for this step to be successful, we show how this information can be propagated to an analysis of the entire tree. In this way, we obtain the probability distribution for the entire system to be attacked successfully as time progresses. For our approach to be effective, we take great care to always work with the best possible compression of the representations of the probability distributions arising. This is achieved by an elegant calculus of acyclic phase type distributions, together with an effective compositional compression technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on three case studies, exhibiting orders of magnitude of compression.','',1,'Florian ArnoldHolger HermannsReza PulunganMariëlle Stoelinga','springer/webservice security.csv','springer','\0'),(1274,'Static analysis for web service security - Tools & techniques for a secure development life cycle','2015','','Cyber Security; Penetration Testing; RESTFul API; Secure Design; Secure Software Development; Security Code Review; Service Oriented Architecture; SOA; SOAP; Source Code Analysis; Static Analysis Tool; Static Code Analysis; Web Application security; Web Services; Web Services Security','In this ubiquitous IoT (Internet of Things) era, web services have become a vital part of today\'s critical national and public sector infrastructure.With the industry wide adaptation of service-oriented architecture (SOA), web services have become an integral component of enterprise software eco-system, resulting in new security challenges.

The basic underlying concept of this approach is the definition of abstract models that can be transformed to obtain models near implementation. One fairly widespread proposal in this sphere is that of Model Driven Architecture (MDA). Business process models are abstract models which additionally contain key information about the tasks that are being carried out to achieve the company\'s goals, and two notations currently exist for modelling business processes: the Unified Modelling Language (UML), through activity diagrams, and the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). Objective: Our research is particularly focused on security requirements, in such a way that security is modelled along with the other aspects that are included in a business process. To this end, in earlier works we have defined a metamodel called secure business process (SBP), which may assist in the process of developing software as a source of highly valuable requirements (including very abstract security requirements), which are transformed into models with a lower abstraction level, such as analysis class diagrams and use case diagrams through the approach presented in this paper. Method: We have defined all the transformation rules necessary to obtain analysis class diagrams and use case diagrams from SBP, and refined them through the characteristic iterative process of the action-research method. Results: We have obtained a set of rules and a checklist that make it possible to automatically obtain a set of UML analysis classes and use cases, starting from SBP models. Our approach has additionally been applied in a real environment in the area of the payment of electrical energy consumption. Conclusions: The application of our proposal shows that our semi-automatic process can be used to obtain a set of useful artifacts for software development processes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers and practitioner need to make systems interoperable and integrate for the benefit of all the stakeholders including hospitals, clinicians, medical support staff, and patients. The broader goal of interoperability can only be achieved when standards are practiced.Two different healthcare systems can earn HL7 conformance and compliance but at the same time can be incompatible for interoperability because of varying implementation of HL7 interaction model. This is mainly because workflows in healthcare systems are very complex. Interoperability on one hand requires flexible mechanism for the mapping of business processes to a standard, HL7 in our example. On the other hand it requires deeper understanding of the standard interaction model and gaps created by their incompatible implementations. In this paper we propose a novel technique of dynamically creating semantic web services as overlay on top of the existing services. We used Web Service Modeling Framework as an underlying architecture for HL7 process artifacts implementation as semantic web services. These semantic services are mapped to our proposed interaction ontology. Integrated reasoning mechanism provides necessary execution semantics for more effective and seamless end-to-end communication.The prototype we tested on different processes from the laboratory domain at a local diagnostic laboratory with uninterrupted process flow.

However the lack of semantic, the competitiveness between services and the dynamicity of service-oriented architectures contexts (mobility, increase of consumers and providers of services, etc.) are the reason of unpredictable events such as service unavailability, high overhead and response time, decrease of reliability, security, etc. Those events ask to adapt the established integration strategies to ensure or improve performance and Quality of Service offered by the Enterprise Service Bus.

Many outsourced webservices can be combined to provide value added services to the users. There are many challenges involved in its implementations. One of the essential challenges is service discovery which involves finding a set of suitable webservice candidates faster. When a large number of functionally-equivalent services have been discovered, it is difficult for users to choose which one is to be invoked. Researchers have proposed various techniques for service discovery like ranking the webservices based on their Quality of Service (QoS). The various parameters of quality are reliability, security, performance, etc. This paper presents an algorithm for building a rule based model for ranking the webservices based on quality of service (QoS) using fuzzy clustering and particle swarm optimization (PSO). In general, the numbers of rules are directly proportional to the number of quality attributes considered for ranking but PSO reduces the number of rules by removing the rules that are having less weightage and will not affect the system.

The urban and built environment research domain is one area that can benefit greatly from Cloud computing. The global population growth and increase in the size and population of cities raise many challenges for governments, planners and researchers alike. The Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN— http://​www.​aurin.​org.​au ) project has been tasked with developing an advanced platform (e-Infrastructure) across Australia to tackle these challenges. The platform leverages large-scale Cloud resources to provide federated data access to, at present over 1100 data sets from major and often definitive government and industry data-rich organisations, and for scalable data processing and visualisation. The original AURIN tools were developed using the object modelling system (OMS) and supported integrated workflows to define and enact/re-enact scientific processes. More recently the work has evolved to focus more on delivery of a workbench offering a rich range of tools delivered through an extensible workflow environment. In this paper, we provide the background to AURIN including the scientific drivers that are shaping the work and the realisation of the Cloud-based AURIN environment. We focus in particular on the workflow environment and show how it seamlessly utilizes the Cloud for urban research processes focused especially on data-intensive spatial analysis. We illustrate the utilisation of this workflow environment across a range of case studies reflecting urban research activities.','International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer',1,'R.

The discovery of services in MANET is a challenging job due to the unique properties of network. In this paper, a novel service discovery framework called hybrid association rules based network layer discovery of services for ad hoc networks (HANDY) has been proposed. HANDY provides three major research contributions. At first, it adopts a cross-layer optimized design for discovery of services that is based on simultaneous discovery of services and corresponding routes. Secondly, it provides a multi-level ontology-based approach to describe the services. This resolves the issue of semantic interoperability among the service consumers in a scalable fashion. Finally, to further optimize the performance of the discovery process, HANDY recommends exploiting the inherent associations present among the services. These associations are used in two ways. First, periodic service advertisements are performed based on these associations. In addition, when a response of a service discovery request is generated, correlated services are also attached with the response. The proposed service discovery scheme has been implemented in JIST/SWANS simulator. The results demonstrate that the proposed modifications give rise to improvement in hit ratio of the service consumers and latency of discovery process.','Wireless Networks',1,'Noman IslamZubair Ahmed ShaikhAqeel-ur RehmanMuhammad Shahab Siddiqui','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(1298,'Model-Driven Design of Object and Component Systems','2016','0',' Component-based architecture Object-oriented design Interfaces Contracts Design patterns rCOS UML','Abstract The notion of software engineering implies that software design and production should be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines that are established in the traditional branches of engineering. The goal is to make development of complex software systems more predictable and the systems developed more trustworthy - safe, secure and dependable . A number of theories have been well developed in the past half a century, including Abstract Data Types , Hoare Logic , Process Calculi , and I/O automata , and those alike. Based on them, techniques and tools have been developed for software specification, refinement and verification. However, the theoretically sound techniques and tools have not been seamlessly integrated in practical software development, and their impact upon commonly-used software systems is still far from convincing to software engineering practitioners. This is clearly reflected by the challenges of their applications in engineering large-scale systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Networks of Things and Cloud-Based Systems, that have multi-dimensional complexities. Indeed, students are not often shown how the theories, and their underpinned techniques and tools, can better inform the software engineering they are traditionally taught. The purpose of this course to demonstrate such an effort. We present a model-driven design framework for component-based and object-oriented software systems. We identify a set of UML notations and textual descriptions for representing different abstractions of software artefacts produced in different development stages. These abstractions, their relations and manipulations all have formalisations in the rCOS formal method of component and object systems. The aim is to allow the advantage of using precise models for development better appreciated.

This makes it possible to have these remote access methods working side by side with more conventional access methods in the control system. This gives you the possibility to access the control system remotely with traditional, already in use rich clients implemented in Java and expanded with an extra layer for the remote communication or you can use other clients in the future, e.g. web applications.

Despite modeling’s and process management’s widespread success, one may argue that it lacks of built-in security mechanisms able to detect and deter threats that may manifest throughout the process. To this end, a variety of different solutions have been proposed by researchers which focus on different threat types. In this paper we examine the insider threat through business processes. Depending on their motives, insiders participating in an organization’s business process may manifest delinquently in a way that causes severe impact to the organization. We examine existing security approaches to tackle down the aforementioned threat in enterprise business processes and propose a preliminary model for a monitoring approach that aims at mitigating the insider threat. This approach enhances business process monitoring tools with information evaluated from Social Media by examining the online behavior of users and pinpoints potential insiders with critical roles in the organization’s processes. Also, this approach highlights the threat introduced in the processes operated by such users. We conclude with some observations on the monitoring results (i.e. psychometric evaluations from the social media analysis) concerning privacy violations and argue that deployment of such systems should be allowed solely on exceptional cases, such as protecting critical infrastructures or monitoring decision making personnel.','',2,'Vasilis StavrouMiltiadis KandiasGeorgios KaroulasDimitris Gritzalis','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1308,'A robustness testing approach for SOAP Web services','2012','3',' Testing Reliability and robustness Web services Benchmarking','Abstract The use of Web services in enterprise applications is quickly increasing. In a Web services environment, providers supply a set of services for consumers. However, although Web services are being used in business-critical environments, there are no practical means to test or compare their robustness to invalid and malicious inputs. In fact, client applications are typically developed with the assumption that the services being used are robust, which is not always the case. Robustness failures in such environments are particularly dangerous, as they may originate vulnerabilities that can be maliciously exploited, with severe consequences for the systems under attack. This paper addresses the problem of robustness testing in Web services environments. The proposed approach is based on a set of robustness tests (including both malicious and non-malicious invalid call parameters) that is used to discover programming and design errors. This approach, useful for both service providers and consumers, is demonstrated by two sets of experiments, showing, respectively, the use of Web services Robustness testing from the consumer and the provider points of view. The experiments comprise the robustness testing of 1,204 Web service operations publicly available in the Internet and of 29 home-implemented services, including two different implementations of the Web services specified by the standard TPC-App performance benchmark. Results show that many Web services are deployed with critical robustness problems and that robustness testing is an effective approach to improve services quality.','Journal of Internet Services and Applications',2,'Nuno LaranjeiroMarco VieiraHenrique Madeira','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1309,'A secure framework for business process execution','2013','','Business processes; Secure framework; Web service; Web service composition','A web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over the World Wide Web.

Such fusion processes stress both traditional fusion-based algorithmic design strategies as well as imputing requirements onto the design of appropriate decentralized architectures. In designing a framework for such an environment, the system architecture must be considered both at the level of information infrastructure and at the network/software level of implementation. From the information infrastructure perspective, primary concerns include which observations will be fed into the system, the intended goals (e.g. data mining, hypothesis generation/testing), how humans interact with the system (e.g. information gathering, analysis, process evaluation/refinement), and which levels of state estimation and fusion are appropriate at a given stage of the process [3]. Bisantz et al [4] discuss aspects of how humans interact with such new distributed networked information fusion systems and identify \"touch points\" where innovations can support improved system performance. An effective network/software architecture is tightly intertwined with the information infrastructure. The former must meet the functional requirements of the latter without adding unnecessary complexity, prohibiting scalability or extensibility, putting undue performance limitations on the system, or compromising system security. Additionally, the system must have the agility and flexibility to successfully and rapidly complete complex tasks that were not possible to anticipate at design-time. This paper presents an information infrastructure for hard and soft fusion that balances the features offered by the current state of the art in computing paradigms (e.g. SOA, ESB) and data representation (e.g. RDF, OWL, TML, EML) with the requirements of our overarching concept of employment for hard and soft fusion capability. The paper provides guidance on determining the optimal software and network architecture design for enabling human-centric and distributed operations in time-critical, vastly heterogeneous, and highly unpredictable conditions.

While necessary, the techniques used to determine compatibility, as a precursor to interaction, come at a substantial computational cost, especially when checks are performed between systems in unrelated domains. To overcome this, we apply machine learning to extract high-level functionality information through text categorisation of a system’s interface description. This categorisation allows us to restrict the scope of compatibility checks, giving an overall performance gain when conducting matchmaking between systems. We have evaluated our approach on a corpus of web service descriptions, where even with moderate categorisation accuracy, a substantial performance benefit can be found. This in turn improves the applicability of our overall approach for achieving interoperability in the Connect project.','',2,'Amel BennaceurValérie IssarnyRichard JohanssonAlessandro MoschittiRomina SpalazzeseDaniel Sykes','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1312,'An immunology-inspired multi-engine anomaly detection system with hybrid particle swarm optimisations','2012','0','Anomaly intrusion detection;Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov model;Immunology;Multiple detection engines','In this paper, multiple detection engines with multi-layered intrusion detection mechanisms are proposed for enhancing computer security.

Legally, we found that the possibility to detect subsequent changes is important for the Statutory Trust.

The existing definition on integrity lack a precise notion of which changes should not invalidate a corresponding digital signature and also lack notions to distinguish levels of detection. We give a new definition for Data Integrity including two notions: Authorized changes, these are changes which do not compromise the data’s integrity; and their level of detection. Especially, the technical term “Transparency” introduced as a security property for sanitizable signature schemes has an opposite meaning in the legal context. Technically, cryptography can allow authorized changes and keep them unrecognisably hidden. Legally, keeping them invisible removes the Statutory Trust.

Thereby, specifying the architecture of SCCSs, based on FA and TA, becomes a key issue for stakeholders of the domain. In this paper, we propose an architecture modeling methodology (named as SAMM) for describing the architecture of SCCSs. SAMM is derived by following a systematic and generic framework—modeling Goal, domain-specific Conceptual model, architecture Viewpoint, and architecture description Language (GCVL), which guides domain experts to devise domain-specific architecture modeling methodologies of large-scale software-intensive systems. SAMM contains three viewpoints and 22 models, and a UML/SysML-based architecture description language. An industrial application of SAMM, along with the subsequent application of the derived SAMM architecture model (i.e., a deployed SCCS prototype) was conducted to evaluate SAMM. A questionnaire-based survey was also conducted to subjectively evaluate whether SAMM meets the modeling goals and its applicability. Results show that SAMM meets all modeling goals and is easy to apply.','Software & Systems Modeling',1,'Zhiqiang FanTao YueLi Zhang','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(1320,'Model-Driven Composition of Information Systems from Shared Components and Connectors','2013','0',' information system engineering component model model-driven engineering','Abstract We introduce CompIS, an approach, model and platform for model-driven component-based information system engineering. Our approach is based on the concept of shared components and connectors between them. To address the data-intensive nature of information systems, our components follow an extended model-view-control structure that also includes data. Component composition is based on configurable connectors, which define the collaboration logic between components and support component composition at the level of the component model, view, control and data. The CompIS UML profile allows to graphically define new components, connectors and compositions. The CompIS platform is a model-driven engineering environment, based on an extended object database that natively integrates the CompIS model. From graphical UML model definitions, the platform automatically generates application code that creates and initialises components and connectors.

However, SOA introduces new security challenges not present in the single-hop client-server architectures due to the involvement of multiple service providers in a service request. The interactions of independent service domains in SOA could violate service policies or SLAs. In addition, users in SOA systems have no control on what happens in the chain of service invocations. Although the establishment of trust across all involved partners is required as a prerequisite to ensure secure interactions, still a new end-to-end security auditing mechanism is needed to verify the actual service invocations and its conformance to the expected service orchestration. In this paper, we provide an efficient solution for end-to-end security auditing in SOA. The proposed security architecture introduces two new components called taint analysis and trust broker in addition to taking advantages of WS-Security and WS-Trust standards. The interaction of these components maintains session auditing and dynamic trust among services. This solution is transparent to the services, which allows auditing of legacy services without modification. Moreover, we have implemented a prototype of the proposed approach and verified its effectiveness in a LAN setting and the Amazon EC2 cloud computing infrastructure.','Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS), 2012 IEEE 31st Symposium on',1,'M.

In the times of Internet, this task has been becoming harder every day. To date, computer science has not solved how to prevent the misuse of business processes. While data objects can be protected, a process cannot. The reason is the security of a process depends not only on its individual accesses and can only be accessed upon the process’ termination or when cast into the context of other processes. Many unbelievable scandals encompassing sophisticated and powerful players, from Microsoft to Sony and credit card operators, from leakages in governments to cyber crime and war attacks could not be prevented despite heavy investment in security. The claim here is that the way in which computer science deals with security does not apply to processes. The key discipline in security is “cryptography”, where the “laureate” Prof. Buchmann got his distinction from. This paper is about how cryptography can be applied as a basis to automate security and give participants in a market an equal position and prevent fraud. To complicate the issue, the goal is security in business processes. The reason is obvious. If one makes mistakes or vulnerabilities are left uncovered, huge fraud incidents might happen, the stockowners rebel, the government complains and employees are, in the worst case, deprived from their pension. This is a real, sensitive issue, with unclear solutions, ambivalent in nature, but rigorous in punishment. The issue is not just to protect, but also to deter “bad things”, such as criminal intents. The option to judge people’s intentions is not an option for mankind; it is not an option though for computer science. We need to automate security and establish procedures that, upon the event of misuse, ascertain accountability. The main goal and challenge of security in business processes is, on one hand, to provide well-founded guarantees regarding the adherence to security, privacy and regulatory compliance requirements and, on the other hand, to integrate the corresponding mechanisms into the business process management lifecycle. This paper introduces this research area, its current status and upcoming practical challenges.','',2,'Günter MüllerRafael Accorsi','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1327,'Reactive Service Selection in Dynamic Service Environments','2012','1',' service composition adaptive service selection quality of service','Abstract Due to the highly dynamic nature of services (web services can enter or leave the system at any time, or change their characteristics), adaptation to change during service composition is necessary to meet user needs. Yet current approaches to change handling detect quality violations and service unavailability only after their occurrence (after executing the corresponding service), resulting in undesired situations at execution time from which recovery (usually through costly replanning) might not always be possible. In response, this paper presents a novel reactive selection algorithm, which adapts to changes in the environment efficiently while performing the selection, ensuring that the selected composite service is executable, satisfactory and optimal prior to execution. The algorithm’s effectiveness is demonstrated via experimental results.','',2,'Lina BarakatSimon MilesMichael Luck','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1328,'Automatic Top-Down Role Engineering Framework Using Natural Language Processing Techniques','2015','0',' Role Based Access Control Role engineering Semantic role labeling Natural language processing Privacy policy','Abstract A challenging problem in managing large networks is the complexity of security administration. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is the most well-known access control model in diverse enterprises of all sizes because of its ease of administration as well as economic benefits it provides. Deploying such system requires identifying a complete set of roles which are correct and efficient. This process, called role engineering, has been identified as one of the most expensive tasks in migrating to RBAC. Numerous bottom-up, top-down, and hybrid role mining approaches have been proposed due to increased interest in role engineering in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new top-down role engineering approach and take the first step towards extracting access control policies from unrestricted natural language requirements documents. Most organizations have high-level requirement specifications that include a set of access control policies which describes allowable operations for the system. It is very time consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone to manually sift through these natural language documents to identify and extract access control policies. We propose to use natural language processing techniques, more specifically Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) to automatically extract access control policies from these documents, define roles, and build an RBAC system. By successfully applying semantic role labeling to identify predicate-argument structure, and using a set of predefined rules on the extracted arguments, we were able correctly identify access control policies with a precision of 79%, recall of 88%, and \\( F_{1} \\) score of 82%.','',2,'Masoud NaroueiHassan Takabi','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1329,'Human Task Management for RESTful Services','2012','0',' Human Task Management REST Hypermedia','Abstract Human task management is an integral part of WS-* based service-oriented solutions like ESBs as human interactions are important for business processes.

When an end user invokes such a virtual service through its GUI to answer his/her functional need, the software service that best responds to the end-user’s selection policy is selected and executed and the result is then rendered to the end-user through the GUI of the virtual service. A key innovation in this paper is the flexibility of our proposed service selection policy. First, each selection policy can refer to heterogeneous parameters (e.g., service price, end-user location, and QoS). Second, additional parameters can be added to an existing or new policy with little investment. Third, the end users themselves define a selection policy to apply during the selection process, thanks to the GUI element added as part of the virtual service design.

For a long time, SOAP and its related stack of standards have been the only technological choice for implementing SOA-based systems. With the increased adoption of the REST concept, an alternative to SOAP is gaining traction. Security considerations have been part of the SOAP-based standardization work since the very beginning. As a result, a mature and comprehensive set of security-related standards is available for building SOAP-based service systems. REST-ful service systems, however, cannot take advantage of such a fully developed security framework yet. This paper therefore revisits the SOAP-based web services security stack in order to identify commonalities, differences and gaps in the security available for REST-ful services.

In addition, Service-oriented Computing has been adopted to realize business processes, which basically consists of executing the process activities using services available in the Internet. In this context, the importance of security is apparent, because sensitive data sent over the Internet may be accessed by unauthorized third-parties. To prevent security problems, users may associate security requirements that must be enforced in essential tasks of the business process. This fact leads to the need of automation, because both functional and security requirements should be modeled, at high-level, and enforced, at execution level.

The use of a cloud-based solution facilitates the deployment process because all needed resources are available in the cloud and ready to be used. In addition, the cloud is also used as a platform in order to provide specific services, such as translators, to support the automation process.

Different smart grid services in different control centers collaborate to realize the real-time control and protection of power systems. The publish/subscribe paradigm makes smart grid service collaborations more real-time and flexible because of the space, time and control decoupling of event producer and consumer, which can be used to establish an appropriate communication infrastructure. Unfortunately, a publish/ subscribe-based smart grid service does not know who consumes its events, and consumers do not know who produces the events either. In this environment, the smart grid service cannot directly control access because of anonymous and indirect service interactions. To address the above issues, this paper at first describes the service communication foundation for smart grid services, and then defines their security model supporting data-centric methodology. Based on such model, underpinning network capabilities can be integrated to help smart grid services control access. The key point in our access control solution is to preserve the service interaction characteristics of the publish/subscribe-based smart grid services: anonymous, multicast and session-control. So two special kinds of event types are used to accomplish authorization request and granting with being consistent with the publish/subscribe paradigm. Attaching policy method is adopted to preserve the anonymity feature for collaborating smart grid services.

The composition of non-functional behavior from different non-functional domains such as security, reliability, and performance is particularly complex. Finding a valid composition is challenging because there are different types of interdependencies between concerns, e.g. mutual exclusion, conflicts, and ordering restrictions, which should not be violated. In this paper we formalize a set of interdependency types between non-functional actions realizing non-functional behavior. These interdependencies can either be specified explicitly or implicitly by taking action properties into account. This rich set of interdependencies can then be used to ease the task of action composition by validating compositions against interdependency constraints, proposing conflict resolution strategies, and by applying our guided composition procedure. This procedure proposes next valid modeling steps leading to conflict-free compositions.','',2,'Benjamin SchmelingAnis CharfiMarko MartinMira Mezini','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer','\0'),(1347,'Cloud Computing, Networking, and Services','2012','2','','','Journal of Network and Systems Management',1,'Bhumip KhasnabishDijiang HuangXiaoying BaiPaolo BellavistaGregorio MartinezNick Antonopoulos','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1348,'Service-oriented middleware for collaborative UAVs','2013','3','Collaborative UAVs;Middleware;Service-Oriented Computing;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles','For a while, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) use was limited to military applications, however recently UAVs are also used for a wide range of civilian applications.

In this scenario, where services are usually selected on the basis of clients\' functional preferences, the risk of providing powerful but insecure applications raises, and the problem of guaranteeing and preserving the security of services and business processes becomes stringent. To this aim, we put forward the idea that security certification techniques can be adopted to provide the evidence that a service system has some security properties and behaves as expected. However, existing security certification techniques are not well-suited to the service scenario, since they are designed for static and monolithic software and then cannot support the intrinsic SOA dynamics.

As such, a situation-aware access control approach coupled with purpose-oriented information is of critical importance. Existing approaches are highly domain-specific and they control access to services depending on the specific types of context information without considering the purpose . To achieve situation-aware access control , in this paper we consider purpose-oriented situations rather than conventional situations (e.g., user’s state). We take situation to mean the states of the entities and the states of the relationships between entities that are relevant to the purpose of a resource access request.

Since the number of attacks and their effects increases the more systems are connected, the secure operation of IT systems becomes a fundamental property. In the future, this importance will increase, due to the rise of systems that are directly connected to our environment, e.g., cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. Therefore, it is inevitable to find and fix security-relevant weaknesses as fast as possible. However, established automated security testing techniques such as fuzzing require significant computational effort. In this paper, we propose an approach to combine security testing with usage-based testing in order to increase the efficiency of security testing. The main idea behind our approach is to utilize that little tested parts of a system have a higher probability of containing security-relevant weaknesses than well tested parts. Since the execution of a system by users can also be to some degree being seen as testing, our approach plans to focus the fuzzing efforts such that little used functionality and/or input data are generated. This way, fuzzing is targeted on weakness-prone areas which in turn should improve the efficiency of the security testing.','',1,'Martin A.

However, it comes with challenging security issues. First, the network complexity introduced by the large number of microservices greatly increases the difficulty in monitoring the security of the entire application. Second, microservices are often designed to completely trust each other, therefore compromise of a single microservice may bring down the entire application. The problems are only exacerbated by the cloud, since applications no longer have complete control over their networks. In this paper, we propose a design for security-as-a-service for microservices-based cloud applications.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by deploying the Bro network monitor using FlowTap. Results show that our solution is flexible enough to support various kinds of monitoring scenarios and policies and it incurs minimal overhead (~6%) for real world usage.

To cover the needs of existing research projects like Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) or Collaborative Actions for Renovation of Air Traffic Systems (CARATS), FREQUENTIS works on a reference architecture with the goal of reusability across domains. This paper describes the current results of SESAR SWIM in the form of requirements and capability definitions that a compatible information system needs to fulfill. Those capabilities are basically derived from major topics of interest within the SWIM Technical Infrastructure such as interoperable communication, security, and governance. Following requirements and capabilities, FREQUENTIS creates a conceptual architecture utilizing artifact types from several commonly used architectural views (structural, behavioral, deployment) depicting logical structure and interaction among the major sub-systems and their components, as well as information exchange flows. Based on previous logical architecture considerations, a list of appropriate technology standards is given.

In recent years, business process management and optimization has been applied to different cross-cutting concerns such as security, compliance, or Green IT, for example.

We use ecological sustainable adaptation strategies that are described as green business process patterns. The application of such a green business process pattern, however, affects the business process layer, the application component and the infrastructure layer. This implies that changes in the application infrastructure also need to be considered. Hence, we use best practices of cloud application architectures which are described as Cloud patterns. To guide developers through the adaptation process we propose a pattern-based approach in this work. We correlate Cloud patterns relevant for sustainable business processes to green business process patterns and organize them within a classification. To provide concrete implementation support we further annotate these Cloud patterns to application component models that are described with the topology and orchestration specification for cloud applications (TOSCA). Using these annotations, we describe a method that provides the means to optimize business processes based on green business process patterns through adapting the implementation of application components with concrete TOSCA implementation models.','Computing',2,'Alexander NowakTobias BinzChristoph FehlingOliver KoppFrank LeymannSebastian Wagner','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1366,'Architecture for a system providing a common operating picture of critical infrastructure','2015','','','This paper presents an architecture for the Situational Awareness of Critical Infrastructure and Networks (SACIN) framework, which offers a common operating picture of the critical infrastructure with its interdependencies.

With this in mind, the paper proposes some routes towards related solutions by discussing a number of desiderata for establishing a better security transparency between a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and a Cloud Service Consumer (CSC).

There are a number of BPM tools on the market that are available as systems to install locally and as services in the cloud.

This makes it difficult for an organization to select a tool that would fit the business processes at hand. The paper suggests a solution for this problem. The core of the solution is a modeling technique for business processes for eliciting their requirements for a suitable BPM tool. It produces a high-level, business process model, called a “step-relationship” model that depicts the essential characteristics of a process in a paradigm-independent way.

Preserving the privacy of individual data is often critical issue in distributed data mining. In this paper, it proposes the privacy preservation of individual data for both feature and sub-feature selection based on data mining techniques and fuzzy probabilities. For privacy purpose, each party maintains their privacy as the instruction of data miner with the help of fuzzy probabilities as alias values. The techniques have developed for own database of data miner in distributed network with fuzzy system and also evaluation of sub-feature value included for the processing of data mining task. The feature selection has been explained by existing data mining techniques i.e., gain ratio using fuzzy optimization. The estimation of gain ratio based on the relevant inputs for the feature selection has been evaluated within the expected upper and lower bound of fuzzy data set. It mainly focuses on sub-feature selection with privacy algorithm using fuzzy random variables among different parties in distributed environment. The sub-feature selection is uniquely identified for better class prediction. The algorithm provides the idea of selecting sub-feature using fuzzy probabilities with fuzzy frequency data from data miner’s database.

Accuracy and integrity of the information in any hospital system is necessary. Then, this information has to be up-to-date as well to achieve continuous quality improvement in any organization and particularly in a complex area like healthcare. Therefore, diverse information systems must be integrated across the healthcare enterprise. The main objective of this research is to develop a framework for the exchange of patients records located in different hospitals in Saudi Arabia, adding insurance and prescriptions information along with the patient’s record to facilitate the insurance process and to automate the medicine prescription process that is currently manual in most hospitals. The proposed framework aims to improve the regular ways of obtaining patients medical records separated in each hospital. For instance, if a particular patient has different medical records in different hospitals visited by that patient, our architecture focuses on the method by which data should be searched and retrieved efficiently from a database on the cloud from different hospitals by preprocessing the data in current hospital’s and saving them in the database that resides on the cloud. Our system design is based on cloud computing service oriented architecture. Some of the information included in these medical records is: medical history, prescribed medications and allergies, immunization status, laboratory and test results, radiology images, personal stats like age and weight, diagnoses, order tests and appointments. All of these records are identified by the national ID of the patient. these systems will be utilized by web services asp.net based framework, the doctor will use his/her ID and password to enter the system for security and then enter the patient’s ID to send a request for that patient’s record that will be sent back to the doctor, the record will be up-to-date since the last visit of the patient to any hospital in Saudi Arabia. The main aim of this study is to provide a data exchange model of patients records, it is used to decrease the time and cost of patients, and help doctors to get up-to-date and accurate information of patients from the records from any hospital in Saudi Arabia. By using e-Patient medical records and Mirth Connect program which use HEALTH LEVEL 7 (HL7) protocol. HL7 protocol is a standard information format of healthcare for data exchange. We provide a single, complete automated patient medical record to give a better patient care that avoids medical mistakes due to lack of information and unavailability of medical records.','',1,'Lamiaa Fattouh IbrahimSuzan SadekShahd HakeemLana Al-SabbanAsmaa Ibrahim Mohammed AhmedAlaa Hassan Al-Sayed','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1383,'Lightweight information flow control for web services','2012','','','This paper presents a concept of incorporating information flow control (IFC) mechanisms into service-oriented systems.

Safety, pollution, congestion, and travel time are all important concerns that point to needs for improving traffic management and realizing this would concern the supportive services (including ICT services). Technology-independent functionality models are not only needed for better understanding the (used and/or desired) (IT) services and discussing them of full value with both developers and users but also for establishing appropriate traceability that would allow updating the underlying technology accordingly based on desired updates in the service support. That is why business models and service applications need to be considered together. Hence, in addressing service applications for traffic management, we would emphasize on the crucial role of business process analysis and technology-independent modeling. Further, service applications relate to corresponding ICT-based service platforms that provide relevant support - in the case of traffic management, it would be for example: localized monitoring and management of traffic and environmental information collected from various information sources such as sensors, surveillance cameras, and weather stations. Such information should be made available through the services in order to increase reusability, loose coupling and management of different information and their analysis. With regard to this, two significant challenges relate to service discovery and interoperability. This paper, reporting research in progress, emphasizes not only on service applications (particularly for traffic) and relations to business modeling, but also on the challenges mentioned above. In this way, we present some visions on how to better benefit from business models and IT services, for usefully improving traffic management, partially exemplifying this.','',1,'Sapkota B., Van Sinderen M., Shishkov B.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1388,'Evaluation of ASLan mutation operators','2013','','','The AVANTSSAR validation platform is an automated toolset for validating trust and security aspects of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs).

Remote Attestation is a relatively new field of research which enables an authorized party to verify that a trusted environment actually exists on a partner platform. To incorporate this novel concept in to the web services realm, a new mechanism called WS-Attestation has been proposed. This mechanism provides a structural paradigm upon which more fine-grained solutions can be built.

A process model is represented by a set of constraints that must be satisfied during the process execution. An important application of such models is compliance checking: a process model defines then the boundaries in which a system/organisation may work, and the actual behaviour of the system, recorded in an event log, can be checked on its compliance to the given model. A compliance model is often a general one, e.g., applicable for a whole branch of industry, and some constraints used there may be irrelevant for a company in question: for example, a constraint related to property assessment regulations will be irrelevant for a rental agency that does not execute property assessment at all. In this paper, we take the compliance model and the information about past executions of the process instances registered in an event log and, by using a set of patterns, we check which constraints of the compliance model are irrelevant (vacuously satisfied) with respect to the event log. Our compliance patterns are inspired by vacuity detection techniques working on a single trace. However, here we take all the knowledge available in the log into consideration.','',2,'Dennis M. M.

For this type of applications, dependability issues are usually resolved by introducing some form of redundancy in the system. Whereas hardware redundancy schemes have traditionally been defined through static configurations based on worst-case analysis, the enhanced flexibility and interoperability of web services allows for dynamic (self-) management of redundancy at the application layer. Combining this advantage with service-oriented platforms such as OSGi facilitates the replication of software components and their integration within redundancy schemes. The application of such redundancy schemes inevitably comes at a price though — primarily due to the allocation of additional system resources. It is often unknown to the service provider how much redundancy and management complexity is required. Furthermore, the degree of redundancy and the dependability strategy to be employed may be restricted by the budget and requirements of the client, both of which may vary. In this paper, we propose a solution to allow the client to express a trade-off between its dependability requirements and its available budget at request level. A dedicated service provider will then attempt to honour these objectives — failing to do so would obviously result in failure from the client point of view. Furthermore, we show how classical multi-version software fault-tolerance techniques can be augmented with advanced redundancy management leveraging the Web Services Distributed Management standard.','',1,'Roeland DillenJonas BuysVincenzo De FlorioChris Blondia','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1402,'Service-Oriented Ontology and Its Evolution','2012','0',' Web Service Service Ontology Tag Service Relation Service Chain Service Discovery','Abstract Web service was designed to solve the problem of the heterogeneous system integration and make heterogeneous systems interoperable.

On one hand, VTA\'s intrusion-tolerant ability is ensured to design a series of node activated mechanisms to remain threshold values t and n of system private key unchanged. On the other hand, VTA changes threshold values t and n when nodes leave/join authentication server group. Analysis and simulation results show that VTA can not only overcome the disadvantage of those static threshold value schemes, but also largely increase system cost comparing to the schemes not equipped with threshold mechanism for WMNs.','',1,'Guo P., Wang J., Geng X.H., Kim C.S., Kim J.-U.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus',''),(1413,'Ten Problems of Deontic Logic and Normative Reasoning in Computer Science','2012','0',' Deontic logic normative systems input/output logic agency','Abstract This tutorial presents and discusses ten problems of deontic logic and normative reasoning in computer science. Five of the problems have been taken or derived from a list of ten philosophical problems in deontic logic recently discussed by Hansen, Pigozzi and van der Torre. In what sense are obligations different from norms? How to reason about contrary-to-duty norms? How do norms change? How to relate various kinds of permissions? What is the role of constitutive norms? Hansen et al. discuss their ten philosophical problems from the viewpoint of input/output logic as developed by Makinson & van der Torre, and they argue that norms, not ideality, should take the central position in deontic semantics, and that a semantics for norms explicitly represented in the object language by using, e.g., input/output logic normative rules, provides a helpful tool for analyzing, clarifying and solving the problems of deontic logic. However, for applications in computer science and artificial intelligence we have to reconcile the input-output logic representation of norms with representations for agency, informational and motivational modalities (beliefs, intentions), time, actions and decision- and game-theoretic concepts. This leads to five more questions. What is the role of time in deontic reasoning? What is the role of action in deontic reasoning? How can we use norms to influence, solve, or control games? How do we resolve the general problem of norm compliance? How do norms interact with informational modalities such as beliefs and knowledge, and motivational modalities such as intentions and desires?','',2,'Jan BroersenLeendert van der Torre','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1414,'Partial Model Checking for the Verification and Synthesis of Secure Service Compositions','2014','0',' Synthesis of Functional and Secure Processes Secure Service Composition Partial Model Checking Cryptography Process Algebras Quantitative Security','Abstract Security is one of the main aspects of Web Services composition.

To develop a secure SOA application, application-independent protocols (e.g. TLS or Web service security protocols) are used. These protocols guarantee standard security properties like integrity or confidentiality but the critical properties are applicationspecific (e.g. \"a ticket can not be used twice\"). For that, security has to be integrated in the whole development process and application-specific security properties have to be guaranteed. This paper illustrates the modeling of a security-critical service application with UML. The modeling is part of an integrated software engineering approach that encompasses model-driven development. Using the approach, an application based on service-oriented architectures (SOA) is modeled with UML. From this model executable code as well as a formal specification to prove the security of the application is generated automatically. Our approach, called SecureMDD, supports the development of security-critical applications and integrates formal methods to guarantee the security of the system.

These models are unique when compared to other models used in system analysis in that their structure naturally lends itself to an analysis of goal satisfaction. Existing work claims that analysis using goal models can facilitate decision making over functional or design alternatives, using criteria in the model. Many different approaches to the analysis of goal-oriented requirements models have been proposed, including several procedures that analyze the satisfaction or denial of goals. These procedures make different choices in their interpretation of the goal model syntax, the methods to resolve conflicting or partial evidence, and in the way they represent satisfaction. This work uses three available tools implementing seven similar goal satisfaction analysis procedures to analyze three sample goal models. Results are reported and compared. The purpose of this comparison is to understand the ways in which procedural design choices affect analysis results, and how differences in analysis results could lead to different recommendations over alternatives in the model. Our comparison shows that different satisfaction analysis techniques for goal models can produce variable results, depending on the structure of the model. Comparison findings lead us to recommend the use of satisfaction analysis techniques for goal models as only heuristics for decision making. Our results emphasize investigation into the benefits of satisfaction analysis beyond decision making, namely improving model quality, increasing domain knowledge, and facilitating communication.','Requirements Engineering',2,'Jennifer HorkoffEric Yu','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1437,'A high assurance cross-domain guard for use in Service-Oriented Architectures','2015','','cross-domain information exchange; guard; high assurance; service-oriented architectures; SOAP; XML','Access to information in a timely manner is becoming more and more important in military operations.

Since the middleware are distributed, a methodology called the “best-proximity” accessibility is enforced so that the healthcare professionals are able to connect to the middleware that offers the most optimal request–response time. The evaluation of the framework, called Med App, shows that: (1) medical data dissemination and accessibility can be achieved in a low-latency fashion, (2) data state can be managed efficiently through a policy-based consistency model, and (3) the resources of the mobile device can be efficiently utilized through services composition on the middleware.','Network Modeling Analysis in Health Informatics and Bioinformatics',1,'Richard K.

This is because the use of pre-existing software requires the selection, composition and adaptation of prefabricated software parts, as well as the management of some complex problems such as guaranteeing high levels of efficiency and safety in critical domains. In addition to the wide variety of services, pervasive systems are composed of many networked heterogeneous devices with embedded software. In this work, we promote the safe reuse of services in service-based systems using two complementary technologies, Service-Oriented Architecture and Software Product Lines. In order to do this, we extend both the service discovery and composition processes defined in the DAMASCo framework, which currently does not deal with the service variability that constitutes pervasive systems. We use feature models to represent the variability and to self-adapt the services during the composition in a safe way taking context changes into consideration. We illustrate our proposal with a case study related to the driving domain of an Intelligent Transportation System, handling the context information of the environment.','',2,'Javier CuboNadia GamezLidia FuentesErnesto Pimentel','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1458,'SOA-Readiness of REST','2014','1',' SOA REST Service Discovery Service Coupling','Abstract SOA is a core concept for designing distributed applications based on the abstraction of software services. The main strength lies in the ability to discover services and loosely-couple them with service consumers across platform-boundaries. The evolved service protocol SOAP and its accompanying standards provide a stable, rich and wide-spread technology stack for implementing SOA-based systems. As an alternative approach to design and implement distributed systems based on services, the architectural style REST gains traction, due to its more light-weight and data format independent nature. Whether REST is also suited for acting as a basis for implementing SOA-based systems is still an open issue, however. This paper focuses on this question and provides an analysis on the SOA-readiness of REST. Both, a theoretical analysis and an empirical study of REST frameworks have been conducted in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding on this matter. The results show a lack of core SOA principles mainly related to the discoverability and the loose coupling of services.','',1,'Peter Leo GorskiLuigi Lo IaconoHoai Viet NguyenDaniel Behnam Torkian','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1459,'A Framework for Privacy Protection and Usage Control of Personal Data in a Smart City Scenario','2013','1',' Identity management privacy protection usage control smart cities trust negotiation','Abstract In this paper we address trust and privacy protection issues related to identity and personal data provided by citizens in a smart city environment.

Current solutions and efforts tackling the vendor lock-in problem are predominantly technology-oriented. Limited studies exist to analyse and highlight the complexity of vendor lock-in problem in the cloud environment. Consequently, most customers are unaware of proprietary standards which inhibit interoperability and portability of applications when taking services from vendors. This paper provides a critical analysis of the vendor lock-in problem, from a business perspective. A survey based on qualitative and quantitative approaches conducted in this study has identified the main risk factors that give rise to lock-in situations. The analysis of our survey of 114 participants shows that, as computing resources migrate from on-premise to the cloud, the vendor lock-in problem is exacerbated. Furthermore, the findings exemplify the importance of interoperability, portability and standards in cloud computing. A number of strategies are proposed on how to avoid and mitigate lock-in risks when migrating to cloud computing. The strategies relate to contracts, selection of vendors that support standardised formats and protocols regarding standard data structures and APIs, developing awareness of commonalities and dependencies among cloud-based solutions.

In many supply chains, individual parties in the chain work with low quality data for their operations and compliance, even though somewhere in the supply chain, better data is available. In the European CASSANDRA project, ICT-supported information infrastructures are developed to exchange data between businesses and government, to support visibility on the supply chain and the re-use of information. However, to gain better data, actors need to be open about their operations, processes and systems to parties that are geographically and culturally on the other side of the world.

To resolve this problem, we analyze the main factors that cause model inconsistency. The analysis methods used for traditional distributed simulations are mostly empirical and qualitative, and disregard the dynamic characteristics of factor evolution in model operational running. Furthermore, distributed simulation applications (DSAs) are rapidly evolving in terms of large-scale, distributed, service-oriented, compositional, and dynamic features. Such developments present difficulty in the use of traditional analysis methods in DSAs, for the analysis of factorial effects on simulation models. To solve these problems, we construct a dynamic evolution mechanism of model consistency, called the connected model hyper-digraph (CMH). CMH is developed using formal methods that accurately specify the evolutional processes and activities of models (i.e., self-evolution, interoperability, compositionality, and authenticity). We also develop an algorithm of model consistency evolution (AMCE) based on CMH to quantitatively and dynamically evaluate influencing factors. Experimental results demonstrate that non-combination (33.7% on average) is the most influential factor, non-single-directed understanding (26.6%) is the second most influential, and non-double-directed understanding (5.0%) is the least influential. Unlike previous analysis methods, AMCE provides good feasibility and effectiveness. This research can serve as guidance for designers of consistency maintenance technologies toward achieving a high level of consistency in future DSAs.','Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE C',1,'Lin-jun FanYun-xiang LingXing-tao ZhangJun Tang','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(1478,'An Architecture for Dynamic Web Service Provisioning Using Peer-to-Peer Networks','2013','2',' Peer-to-Peer UDDI SOA Web Services Grid Computing Virtual Organization Virtual Market Place','Abstract Grid computing has made it possible for users to create complex applications by combining globally distributed data and analysis components and deploy them on geographically distributed resources for execution. Introduction of ad-hoc Virtual Organizations based on on-demand service provisioning further enhances this architectural concept. Job-based paradigms or reliance on relatively static UDDI lead to a failure in offering the complete dynamism of a heterogeneous distributed Grid. A possible alternative is the use of dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques within a Web Service based Grid to introduce the ability of the network to adapt to resource volatility already established in P2P-based content-delivery models. In this paper, we present the architecture of a demand-driven Web Service deployment framework that allows sharing of data and computing capacity using P2P technology as its backbone. We focus on various issues such as resource availability, scalability and abstraction. Demand-driven resource allocation is based on request parameters and availability of the resources to create the basis for a fully dynamic virtual market place of computational resources.','',1,'Sujoy MistryDibyanshu JaiswalSagar ViraniArijit MukherjeeNandini Mukherjee','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1479,'On Patterns for Decentralized Control in Self-Adaptive Systems','2013','14','','Abstract Self-adaptation is typically realized using a control loop. One prominent approach for organizing a control loop in self-adaptive systems is by means of four components that are responsible for the primary functions of self-adaptation: Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute, together forming a MAPE loop. When systems are large, complex, and heterogeneous, a single MAPE loop may not be sufficient for managing all adaptation in a system, so multiple MAPE loops may be introduced. In self-adaptive systems with multiple MAPE loops, decisions about how to decentralize each of the MAPE functions must be made. These decisions involve how and whether the corresponding functions from multiple loops are to be coordinated (e.g., planning components coordinating to prepare a plan for an adaptation). To foster comprehension of self-adaptive systems with multiple MAPE loops and support reuse of known solutions, it is crucial that we document common design approaches for engineers. As such systematic knowledge is currently lacking, it is timely to reflect on these systems to: (a) consolidate the knowledge in this area, and (b) to develop a systematic approach for describing different types of control in self-adaptive systems. We contribute with a simple notation for describing interacting MAPE loops, which we believe helps in achieving (b), and we use this notation to describe a number of existing patterns of interacting MAPE loops, to begin to fulfill (a). From our study, we outline numerous remaining research challenges in this area.','',1,'Danny WeynsBradley SchmerlVincenzo GrassiSam MalekRaffaela MirandolaChristian PrehoferJochen WuttkeJesper AnderssonHolger GieseKarl M.

Regarding performance, we find that composition size has the strongest effect, with smaller topologies consuming more machine time; a curious effect we believe is due to the influence of crowding distance. Regarding result quality, our results reveal that size and topology have more effect on the front found than the number of service choices discovered. As expected the price-reliability relationship (logarithmic, linear, exponential) is replicated in the front discovered when correlation is high, but as the price-reliability correlation decreases, we find fewer solutions on the front and the front becomes less smooth.','',2,'Mustafa BozkurtMark Harman','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1485,'Extending generic BPM with computer vision capabilities','2016','','BPM; BPMN; Computer vision; Modelling','Leveraging Business Process Management (BPM) is key to enabling business agility in organizations.

In contrast to many approaches that require manual risk analysis, such as fault tree analysis, failure mode and effect analysis, and the CORAS method, we propose an automated approach that takes advantage of an already shown correlation between interface complexity and error proneness. Since fuzzing is a negative testing approach, we propose a complexity metric for the negative input space that measures the boundaries of the negative input space of primitive types and complex data types. Based on this metric, the assumed most error prone interfaces are selected and used as a starting point for fuzz test case generation. This paper presents work in progress.','',1,'Martin A.

However, several key challenges still remain. In particular, the extension and evolution of both DSL syntax and semantics still suffer due to the limitations related to the current state-of-the-art implementation techniques. Such techniques also lack interoperable capabilities among base languages and limited tool support. As changes of domain concepts are omnipresent and more base languages may support DSL implementation, the aforementioned limitations may be no longer tolerable, and hence a new implementation technique to DSL development is desired. This paper implements six DSL case studies (representing imperative, declarative and hybrid categories) to validate the feasibility of utilizing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for DSL implementation. Such case studies also highlight that the advantages of SOA (i.e., ease of evolution/extension, interoperability and tool support) can be retained under the context of DSL development. The paper concludes with the discussion of additional findings, both positive and negative: the SOA-based approach improves modularization at the lexical, syntactical and semantic levels and delegates tokenization/parsing to the underlying WS-BPEL engine; yet, the usability, resource utilization, security, and flexibility of the SOA-based DSLs are degraded, which requires more future work in this unique area that spans SOA and DSLs. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

To assess an architecture’s quality and validate its conformance to behavioral requirements, those models must be subjected to sophisticated static analyses. We propose a comprehensive methodology that relies on data flow analysis for a context-sensitive evaluation of service-oriented system designs. The approach employs a model-based format for SOA artifacts which acts as a uniform basis for the specification and execution of various analyses. Using this methodology, we implement two analyses which reveal blocking calls and assess performance metrics. These applications are evaluated in the context of two case studies that have been developed in the SENSORIA and the ENVIROFI projects.','',2,'Bernhard BauerMelanie LangermeierChristian Saad','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(1509,'A Requirements-Based Model for Effort Estimation in Service-Oriented Systems','2014','0',' Software Engineering Service-oriented Computing Development Costs Estimation','Abstract Assessing the development costs of an application remains an arduous task for many project managers.

In the last decade, several service identification methods (SIMs) were proposed. However, the service identification phase still remains a challenge to organizations due to the lack of systematic methods and comprehensive approaches that support the examination of the businesses from multiple perspectives and consider service quality attributes. This work aims to provide an overview of existing SIMs by detailing which service’s perspectives, stated as relevant by the industry, are addressed by the SIMs and also by synthesizing the identification techniques used by them. We have performed a systematic survey over publications about SIMs from 2002 to June 2013, and 105 studies were selected. A detailed investigation on the analyzed SIMs revealed that the identification techniques applied by them have a correlation on how they address many of the service’s perspectives. In addition, they are supporting the SOA adoption by handling many perspectives of the OASIS’ reference architecture for SOA. However, most of them do not explicitly address service quality attributes and few studies support the evaluation of both. Therefore, future research should follow the direction toward hybrid methods with mechanisms to elicit business and service’s quality attributes.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Rosane S.

The growing migration to cloud computing of the services that make up current pervasive, social applications suggests near-term developments emerging from the same platform(s). Thus, the question considered here is, what pathways, opportunities and challenges exist for the development, wider use and validation of COIN technologies to help realize socio-technical systems that better meet human requirements.

The Jivaro prototype has features such as automated and configurable business processes using BPEL and manual tasks, multitenancy using virtual portals, and security using LDAP. We focus on two specific management pain points: 1. the difficulty in deploying multiple SOA components into multiple target middleware containers, and 2. inconsistency in access control policies for multi-tier applications. For addressing the deployment issues, we present a real-wo rid deployment scenario involving the use of ANT tasks and scripting interfaces. For addressing inconsistencies in access control policies, we present a solution using the XACML standard, a common authorization model developed as an extension of the Java authorization contract for containers and a common policy store and policy administration point. We compare and contrast current access control policies for J2EE containers and databases with the proposed new common authorization model. We also compare separate access control policy stores versus the proposed solution for a common store. Our aggregated role based authorization model provides consistent access control policies that complement single sign-on and identity propagation schemes.

However, our needs can be even better accommodated when the networked devices cooperate and complement each other’s capabilities. One of the initial steps towards achieving a cooperative platform of smart devices is the discovery of resources and capabilities within the network. Today’s operational service discovery protocols carry simple text-based uniform resource identifiers that are not expressive enough. Machines cannot comprehend the meaning of a new service that is not in their knowledge base. In addition to being more expressive, service discovery protocols must compensate the diversity to improve cooperation between the devices that use different application protocols and operate on different communication interfaces. In this paper, we propose the Smart Discovery Protocol (SDP) which outperforms the operational service discovery protocols with three main features: (1) more expressive semantic representation of the services, (2) operating in the network layer to deal with diversity, and (3) unifying existing service discovery protocols. SDP represents services with ontologies as some recently proposed semantic service discovery protocols. It further enhances the success of semantic representations by creating a unified platform that can carry legacy discovery services. In this respect, the novelties of SDP are as follows: firstly, it operates in the network layer and consequently abstracts both the application layer and communication interfaces. Secondly, SDP unifies the legacy service discovery protocols by integrating their simple text-based service representations in one message. The underlying transport mechanism of SDP is designed as an add-on to the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) of the IPv6 standard. The metadata is carried in the payload of ICMPv6 packets. Simple text-based representations of other service discovery protocols are embedded in type-length-value options of NDP. Authenticity of the devices is ensured by the IPv6 Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol. Unlike previous semantic approaches on service discovery, we have implemented our protocol on real hardware. The results demonstrate the feasibility of carrying semantic representations of the services and integration of other service discovery protocols.','Wireless Personal Communications',1,'Yunus DurmusErtan Onur','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(1526,'Design and implementation of an information destruction security service in mixed local area networks','2013','','','This paper focuses on the architecture of mixed LAN-oriented security service components firstly, and then expands each one of them by explaining its design and structural implementation.

We claim it is holistic, because, contrary to most of the available studies it addresses all aspects related to creation and utilization of a medical teleconsultation workspace.We present an extensive analysis of requirements, including possible usage scenarios, user needs, organizational and security issues and infrastructure components. We enumerate and analyze multiple usage scenarios related to medical imaging data in treatment, research and educational applications - with typical teleconsultations treated as just one of many possible options. Certain phases common to all these scenarios have been identified, with the resulting classification distinguishing several modes of operation (local vs. remote, collaborative vs. non-interactive etc.).On this basis we propose a system architecture which addresses all of the identified requirements, applying two key concepts: Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Virtual Organizations (VO). The SOA paradigm allows us to decompose the functionality of the system into several distinct building blocks, ensuring flexibility and reliability. The VO paradigm defines the cooperation model for all participating healthcare institutions.

In recent years many of these tools use visualization designed to make traffic patterns and impact of an attack tangible to a security analyst. The visualizations attempt to facilitate understanding elements of an attack, including the location of malicious activity on a network and the consequences for the wider system. The human observer is able to detect patterns from useful visualizations, and so discover new knowledge about existing data sets. Because of human reasoning, such approaches still have an advantage over automated detection, data-mining and analysis. The core challenge still lies in using the appropriate visualization at the right time. It is this lack of situational awareness that our CyberVis framework is designed to address. In this paper we present a novel approach to the visualization of enterprise network attacks and their subsequent potential consequences. We achieve this by combining traditional network diagram icons with Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN), a risk-propagation logic that connects the network and business-process and task layer, and a flexible alert input schema able to support intrusion alerts from any third-party sensor. Rather than overwhelming a user with excessive amounts of information, CyberVis abstracts the visuals to show only noteworthy information about attack data and indicates potential impact both across the network and on enterprise tasks. CyberVis is designed with the Human Visual System (HVS) in mind, so severe attacks (or many smaller attacks that make up a large risk) appear more salient than other components in the scene. A Deep-Dive window allows for investigation of data, similar to a database interface. Finally, a Forensic Mode allows movie-style playback of past alerts under user-defined conditions for closer examination.','Technologies for Homeland Security (HST), 2013 IEEE International Conference on',2,'S.

In this paper we propose an enhanced smart multi-banking integrated using service oriented composition model by which using single username and password the user can able to access multiple bank accounts. Every user can have more than one bank accounts and each bank provides different username and passwords. To operate his/her account he/she wants to remember all the user name and password of each bank. This Multi Banking Interface is aimed to enhance the current services of the bank to meet the requirements for future-banking world for the users who is having accounts in multiple banks. By using this interface any user who is having accounts in various banks can directly login to Multiple Banks and make any kind of transactions. By using this interface client can also able to see all various bank account summaries in the single page. He/she can get minimum 10 transaction details of all banks. Even amount can be transacted between the banks in the single interface. In addition to this, the main feature of the paper is, Sometimes the client need a particular amount, but all the banks in which he/she has account is having balance lesser then the required amount. For this we are providing a dynamic service composition interface to overcome this problem. Consider `n\' number of banks is going to participate in multi-banking interface. Here one of the banks acts as a primary and remaining are secondary one. Consider the scenario that the user requires the amount of Rs.10000/- but no banks have full-required amount. Now the integrated system checks whether 60% of required amount is available in any of the banks. If so, it takes the amount from the corresponding bank otherwise it checks for 50% of required amount and so on for particular limit. Similarly, the remaining amount is taken from other banks in such criteria. Now the integrated system transfers the amount- which is taken from the secondary banks to primary bank account. Finally From the primary bank account the user can withdraw the required amount. If the client needs to add one more bank he/she can add the bank details and make our system to composite with the existing bank services dynamically.','Computing Communication & Networking Technologies (ICCCNT), 2012 Third International Conference on',1,'P.

Users normally access content from the first few links provided to them by search engines such as Google or Yahoo!. This is assuming that these search engines provide factual information, which may be popular due to criteria such as page rank but may not always be trustworthy from the factual aspects. This paper presents a mechanism to determine trust of websites based on the semantic similarity of their multimedia content with already established and trusted websites. The proposed method allows for dynamic computation of the trust level of websites of different domains and hence overcomes the dependency on traditional user feedback methods for determining trust. In fact, our method attempts to emulate the evolving process of trust that takes place in a user’s mind.

Increasing patient expectations and the advancement of scientific and medical knowledge has had a dramatic effect on the provision of emergency care. Emergency medical services (EMSs) perform pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency care activities, operate 24 h a day/7 days a week and constitute an important link between the community (primary care) and the hospital (secondary and tertiary care). Managing emergency care involves assessing individual needs to create a coordinated plan of care that is consistent with agreed priorities and is designed to bring optimal outcomes using cost-effective care. Emergency care is vital for avoiding death and chronic suffering by the elderly and the homeless, but its overall positive effect on the long-term health and overall well-being of these people can only be improved significantly by applying holistic principles, going beyond basic medical care to offer psychological and social support as far as possible. Thus, creating appropriate emergency care plans requires collaboration and coordination among EMS and social care providers, giving rise to a more holistic approach to emergency care management. In turn, this requires the availability of integrated patient information to authorized individuals of health and social care providers when and where needed. On these grounds, the development of a workflow-based electronic patient record (E-EPR) for emergency care is described which is provided as a service on a cloud. The E-EPR aims at supporting the execution of EMS workflows by providing integrated patient information to EMS process participants and to make this information shareable to health and social care professionals. Due to the heterogeneity of the participating organizations’ information systems, the E-EPR is built on top of an Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)-based collaborative network consisting of EMS agencies and health and social care providers who share patient documents using IHE-based profiles. An experimental implementation of the E-EPR is also described.','Personal and Ubiquitous Computing',1,'M. PoulymenopoulouF. MalamateniouG.

These last, mainly ontology-based, aim at “annotating” multimedia documents by representing, in some way, the “inner meaning/deep content” of these documents. For documents of sufficient size, the content modeling operations are separately executed on ‘significant fragments’ of the documents, e.g., “sentences” for natural language texts or “segments” (minimal units for story advancement) in a video context. The general problem above concerns then the possibility of collecting all the partial conceptual representations into a global one. This integration operation must, moreover, be carried out in such a way that the meaning of the full document could go beyond the simple addition of the ‘meanings’ conveyed by the single fragments. In this context, NKRL makes use of second order knowledge representation structures, “completive construction” and “binding occurrences”, for collecting within the conceptual annotation of a whole “narrative” the basic building blocks corresponding to the representation of its composing elementary events. These solutions, of a quite general nature, are discussed in some depth in this paper. This last includes also a short “state of the art” in the annotation domain and some comparisons with the different methodologies proposed in the past for solving the above ‘integration’ problem.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',1,'Gian Piero Zarri','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1549,'Energy-efficient communication networks for improved global energy productivity','2013','13',' Energy efficiency Power consumption Network elements Core networks Access networks Holistic approach','Abstract Recently, a lot of effort has been put into research and development of energy-efficient devices and systems and into optimization of the network infrastructure with regard to energy consumption.

So far, we have introduced concepts to integrate business processes with process information. A remaining challenge is to identify the process information relevant for a given process context. This paper tackles this challenge and extends our POIL approach with techniques and algorithms for identifying relevant process information. More specifically, we introduce two algorithms for determining the relevance of process information based on their link and rate popularity.

This paper describes an approach to assist software analysts in the definition of produced services, which bases on the fact that poorly designed service interfaces may be due to bad design and implementation decisions present in the legacy system. Besides automatically detecting common design pitfalls, the approach suggests refactorings to correct them.

The properties inferred can include data dependencies, information content, domain-defined attributes, privacy or confidentiality levels, among others. The analysis produces characterizations of the data and the activities in the composition in terms of minimal and maximal sharing, which can then be used to verify compliance of potential adaptation actions, or as supporting information in their generation. This sharing analysis approach can be used both at design time and at run time. In the latter case, the results of analysis can be refined using the composition traces (execution logs) at the point of execution, in order to support run-time adaptation.','Computing',2,'Dragan IvanovićManuel CarroManuel V.

Specifically, we consider a generic IoT’s service scenario: a server provides different kinds of services without knowledge of user satisfaction model and network service period. Our objective aims at dynamically adjusting the power allocation for each service over a uncertain period to maximize expected user satisfaction. It should be noted that practical user satisfaction rate is observed over time, but the inherent functional relationship between the power and satisfaction rate is unknown. In order to present a quantitative analysis, we consider a general user satisfaction model belonging to a class of functions that do not deploy any parametric representation. In this case, a blind dynamic powering algorithm is developed, in which one learns the satisfaction function and optimizes power-aware user satisfaction with on-line operation. More precisely, the algorithm performance is measured in terms of regret which denotes the satisfaction loss compared to the optimal satisfactions that can be obtained when the service period and satisfaction rate are known. Moreover, a tight bound on this regret is proposed for any possible powering policy, and we show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a regret that is close to this bound.','Telecommunication Systems',1,'Liang Zhou','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(1556,'A Structure P2P Based Web Services Registry with Access and Control','2014','0',' Web Service Registry UDDI P2P Pastry Access and Control','Abstract In the cloud computing, there are massive functions and resources are encapsulated into Web services.

At large payment processing firms, there is significant risk of fraud (upto 0.9 %). This fraud can be prevented before the actual transaction phase through risk scoring models. In the post transactions phase, measures like withholding or reserving funds of the seller, or asking for additional supporting material from the seller to release the funds can be done. There are numerous variations based on different geographies or different seller classes or different holding mechanisms of these measures. It was found that the software being developed for a payment system was combining both infrastructural software (database, queue, logs) as well the actual risk business process. Subsequently, prototypes were created for different risk measures in the post transaction phase using executable BPMN2 (using Activiti engine). For example, a certain amount of money may be withheld from the seller for a configurable time period which can be edited in the graphical BPMN2. In this paper, we discuss the numerous types of transactions, the numerous measures for financial risk and how BPMN2, can be used to model the same and at the same time form a performant executable component reducing development time. It is also possible that such models can be standardized and exchanged in the industry.','',2,'Ramkumar IyerSanjeevi Moorthy','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(1569,'Agent-Based Self-Adaptable Context-Aware Network Vulnerability Assessment','2013','1','Vulnerability assessment;agent-based system;intrusion detection system (IDS);management information base (MIB);threats awareness analysis','Immunology inspired computer security has attracted enormous attention as its potential impacts on the next generation service-oriented network operation system.

Negotiation by electronic means has been an area of intensive research for many years now. However, most effort was put on the determination of prices and neglected that real-world agreements also consist of complex dependencies of interdependent obligations. In this paper we present agreement negotiation as a tool to establish ad hoc services collaborations. Our novel protocol allows for the discovery of complex agreement options and for the formation of multi-party agreements. The protocol works through an iterative exchange of requirements and offers. A major benefit over existing bilateral negotiation protocols is that our protocol is capable of discovering potential collaborations between different parties. It will leave each negotiating party with a complete agreement document after a successful negotiation.

This has resulted in the loss of confidence and trust of the public towards the organisations’ ability to protect the patients’ private information. The Generic Security Template (G.S.T.) has been proposed to communicate security lessons learned from previous security incidents. This paper conducts a series of empirical studies to evaluate the usability of the G.S.T. The first study compares the G.S.T. with the conventional text-based security incident reports. The two methods were compared in term of the users’ ability to identify a number of lessons learned from investigations into previous incidents involving the disclosure of healthcare records. The study showed that the graphical approach resulted in higher accuracy in terms of number of correct answers generated by participants. However, subjective feedback raised further questions about the usability of the G.S.T. as the readers of security incident reports try to interpret the lessons that can increase the security of patient data.

A multi-faceted framework to enforce minimal levels of security not only at the level of the network (e.g., using encryption), but also of business processes, is of paramount importance. To address this challenge, we explore an event-driven framework for service oriented computing (EFSOC) that is organized in four tiers: the event tier, the business process tier, the resource tier, and the access control tier. The event tier encompasses definitions of business-related events, and supports their propagation throughout the business process flow. The business process tier specifies the dynamic interactions between business processes and services. The resource tier describes how service invocations interact with organizational resources, while the access control tier defines access roles that are allowed to invoke certain services.','Research Issues on Data Engineering: Web Services for e-Commerce and e-Government Applications, 2004.

Existing tools typically only address a specific part of the problem (e.g., control plane verification, flow checker). In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle SDN fault localization by automatically Modeling via Policy Inference (called MPI ) the causality between SDN faults and their symptoms to a belief network. In the MPI system, a service oriented high level policy language is used to specify network services provisioned between end nodes. MPI parses each service provisioning policy to a logical policy view, which consists of a pair of logical end nodes, a traffic pattern specification, and a list of required network functions (or a service function chain). An SDN controller takes the policies from multiple parties and provisions the requested services on its orchestrated SDN network. MPI queries the controller about the network topology and retrieves flow rules from all SDN switches. MPI maps the policy view to the corresponding implementation view, in which all the logical components in the policy view are mapped to the actual system components along with the actual network topology. Referring to the component causality graph templates derived from SDN reference model, the implementation view of the current running network services can be modeled as a belief network. A heuristic fault reasoning algorithm is adopted to search for the most likely root causes. MPI has been evaluated in both a simulation environment and a real network system for its accuracy and efficiency. The evaluation shows that MPI is a highly scalable, effective and flexible modeling approach to tackle fault localization challenges in a highly dynamic and agile SDN network.','Journal of Internet Services and Applications',1,'Yongning TangGuang ChengZhiwei XuFeng ChenKhalid ElmansorYangxuan Wu','springer/webservice security.csv','springer',''),(1591,'A feasibility study of SOA-enabled networked rock bolts','2014','','','The use of rock bolts in the mining industry is a widely used approach for increasing mine stability. However, when compared to the automation industry, where the use of sensors and real-time monitoring of processes have evolved rapidly, the use rock bolts have not changed a lot during the last 100 years. What is missing are technologies for keeping installed rock bolts under real-time and online monitoring. One problem is that rock bolts can become damaged by seismic activities or movements within the rock, and thus lose their load bearing capacity. If that happens, the outer shell of a tunnel\'s walls or ceiling can collapse, with disaster as a result. Therefore, there is a clear need for online and real-time monitoring solutions for strain and thereby stress, as well as seismic activity. In this paper, the current state of art in research around intelligent rock bolts is presented. An intelligent rock bolt is the combination of a traditional rock bolt with an Internet of Things device, i.e. a rock bolt with embedded sensors, actuators, processing capabilities and wireless communication. In the proposed architecture, every rock bolt has its own IPv6 address and can establish a wireless mesh network in an ad-hoc manner. By measuring strain and seismic activity and exposing the sensors in the form of services, large gains in terms of safety and efficiently can be achieved. A number of mining related activities such as stress on the rock bolt can be detected, falling rocks and the presence of mobile machinery can be observed. Since the network is based on standard communication protocols such as IPv6, it is vital to add security mechanisms to prevent eavesdropping and tampering of data traffic. By utilizing the real-time monitoring capabilities of a network of Internet-connected intelligent rock bolt, it is possible to drastically improve monitoring of mining activities and thereby providing workers with a safer working environment. © 2014 IEEE.','',1,'Eliasson J., Pereira P.P., Mäkitaavola H., Delsing J., Nilsson J., Gebart J.','scopus/soa security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1592,'Automated Resource Assignment in BPMN Models Using RACI Matrices','2012','2',' Responsibility management RACI matrix RACI-aware BPMN model RASCI sub-process RASCI meta model','Abstract Organizations need to manage the responsibility of their employees with respect to all the activities that are daily carried out within them.

This infrastructure made it possible to securely and reliably take advantage of widely separated computational resources that are part of several different organizations. Resources can be incorporated to the Grid, building a theoretical virtual supercomputer. In time, cloud computing emerged as a new type of large scale distributed system, inheriting and expanding the expertise and knowledge that have been obtained so far. Some of the main characteristics of Grids naturally evolved into clouds, others were modified and adapted and others were simply discarded or postponed. Regardless of these technical specifics, both Grids and clouds together can be considered as one of the most important advances in large scale distributed computing of the past ten years; however, this step in distributed computing has came along with a completely new level of complexity. Grid and cloud management mechanisms play a key role, and correct analysis and understanding of the system behavior are needed. Large scale distributed systems must be able to self-manage, incorporating autonomic features capable of controlling and optimizing all resources and services. Traditional distributed computing management mechanisms analyze each resource separately and adjust specific parameters of each one of them. When trying to adapt the same procedures to Grid and cloud computing, the vast complexity of these systems can make this task extremely complicated. But large scale distributed systems complexity could only be a matter of perspective. It could be possible to understand the Grid or cloud behavior as a single entity, instead of a set of resources. This abstraction could provide a different understanding of the system, describing large scale behavior and global events that probably would not be detected analyzing each resource separately. In this work we define a theoretical framework that combines both ideas, multiple resources and single entity, to develop large scale distributed systems management techniques aimed at system performance optimization, increased dependability and Quality of Service (QoS). The resulting synergy could be the key to address the most important difficulties of Grid and cloud management.','Journal of Grid Computing',1,'Jesús MontesAlberto SánchezMaría S.

Although BPM matured as a research discipline, there are still various important open problems. Moreover, despite the broad interest in BPM, the adoption of state-of-the-art results by software vendors, consultants, and end-users leaves much to be desired.

The capability of supporting top- k cyclic graph queries over a data graph provides much more flexibility for a user to search graphs. And the problem itself is challenging. After investigating a direct yet infeasible solution, we propose a new twig query approach. In our approach, we first identify a spanning tree of the cyclic graph query, which is used to generate a list of ranked twig answers on-demand. Then we identify the top- k answers for the graph query based on the twig answer list. In order to find the best twig query in solving a given cyclic graph query, cost-based optimization for twig query selection is studied.

Even though many languages and approaches have been proposed for model management, most of them are type-centric, specific to concrete meta-models, and hence leading to specifications with a low level of abstraction and difficult to be reused in practice. In this paper, we introduce ideas from generic programming into model management to raise the level of abstraction of the specifications of model manipulations and facilitate their reuse. In particular we adopt generic meta-model concepts as an intermediate, abstract meta-model over which model management specifications are defined. Such meta-model concepts are mapped to concrete meta-models, so that specifications can be applied to families of meta-models satisfying the concept requirements. As a proof of concept, we show the implementation of these ideas using the Eclipse Modeling Framework and the Epsilon family of languages for model management.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Louis RoseEsther GuerraJuan de LaraAnne EtienDimitris KolovosRichard Paige','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer','\0'),(1600,'Contractual proximity of business services','2015','','Goal modeling; Outsourcing; Quality of service; Service composition; Service contract; Service engineering; Serviceability','Business services arguably play a central role in service-based information systems as they would fill in the gap between the technicality of Service-Oriented Architecture and the business aspects captured in Enterprise Architecture. Business services have distinctive features that are not typically observed in Web services, e.g. significant portions of the functionality of business services might be executed in a humanmediated fashion. The representation of business services requires that we view human activity and human-mediated functionality through the lens of computing and systems engineering. Given the specification of a relatively complex business service, practitioners can deal with its complexity either by breaking it down into constituent services through common practices such as outsourcing or delegation, or by picking up an existing group of services (e.g. from a service catalog) that best realize that functionality. To address these challenges, we devise a formal machinery to (averify if a group of services contractually match the specification of the larger service in question; (b) to assess the contractual proximity of service groups relative to a contractual service specification to help decide which combination of services from a catalog best realize the desired functionality.

After that, the services are packaged in our already developed service micro-containers and deployed in any target PaaS. For the slicing, we defined algorithms to slice their correspondent Petri net into a set of dependent WF-nets and to determine the orchestration to follow for their execution.

However, reality may not agree with what is modeled. Conformance checking techniques reveal and diagnose differences between the behavior that is modeled and what is observed. Existing conformance checking approaches tend to focus on the control-flow in a process, while abstracting from data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints. Even in those situations when other perspectives are considered, the control-flow is aligned first, i.e., priority is given to this perspective. Data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints are only considered as “second-class citizens”, which may lead to misleading conformance diagnostics. For example, a data attribute may provide strong evidence that the wrong activity was executed. Existing techniques will still diagnose the data-flow as deviating, whereas our approach will indeed point out that the control-flow is deviating. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed that balances the deviations with respect to all these perspectives based on a customizable cost function. Evaluations using both synthetic and real data sets show that a multi-perspective approach is indeed feasible and may help to circumvent misleading results as generated by classical single-perspective or staged approaches.','Computing',2,'Felix MannhardtMassimiliano de LeoniHajo A.

To achieve this objective, EAM creates, maintains and analyzes a model of the current state of the Enterprise Architecture. This model covers different concepts reflecting both the business and the IT perspective and has to be constantly maintained in response to ongoing transformations of the enterprise. In practice, EA models grow large and are difficult to maintain, since many stakeholders from various backgrounds have to contribute architecture-relevant information.

Current research approaches target the automation of the EA documentation based on specific data sources. These approaches, as our systematic literature review showed, do not consider enterprise specificity of the documentation context or the variability of the data sources from organization to organization. The approach presented in this article specifically accounts for these factors and presents a situational method for EA documentation. It builds on four process-supported documentation techniques which can be selected, composed and applied to design an organization-specific documentation process. The techniques build on a meta-model for EA documentation, which is implemented in an EA-repository prototype that supports the configuration and execution of the documentation techniques.

Refactoring, which was first introduced for source code, has been extended for use case models. Antipatterns are low quality solutions to commonly occurring design problems. The presence of antipatterns in a use case model is likely to propagate defects to other software artifacts. Therefore, detection and refactoring of antipatterns in use case models is crucial for ensuring the overall quality of a software system. Model transformation can greatly ease several software development activities including model refactoring. In this paper, a model transformation approach is proposed for improving the quality of use case models. Model transformations which can detect antipattern instances in a given use case model, and refactor them appropriately are defined and implemented. The practicability of the approach is demonstrated by applying it on a case study that pertains to biodiversity database system.

Therefore, they need to dynamically adapt their behavior. It is of paramount importance to specify and analyze the intended behavior of these systems before they are fully implemented. The behavioral specification can be used for requirements validation in order to check if these systems will be able to achieve their goals. Moreover, the reasoning about properties of these systems, such as deadlocks, reachability, completeness and correctness of the system, can be supported. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to have an approach to specify the dynamic behavior of the context-sensitive systems. In this work, we propose the GO2S (GOals to Statecharts) process to systematically derive the behavior of context-sensitive systems, expressed as statecharts, from requirements models, described as goal models. Results The GO2S process addresses the specification of the tasks required for monitoring of requirements satisfaction as well as the system adaptation according to the context, the operationalization of non-functional requirements and prioritization of alternatives to be used at runtime (variants). It is an iterative process centered on the incremental refinement of a goal model, obtaining different views of the system (design, contextual, behavioral). Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate the statecharts produced following GO2S process (experimental group) in relation to the ones elaborated in ad-hoc fashion (control group). Conclusions The experiment results showed that the structural complexity of the statecharts of the experimental group was lower in relation to the control group. Moreover, the average of functionalities whose behavior was modeled according to the specification and the time spent to produce the models of the experimental group were higher in relation to the control group. Besides, the subjects agreed that the GO2S process is easy to use.','Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development',2,'Jéssyka VilelaJaelson CastroJoão Pimentel','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1626,'A Tool to Support the Collection of User Preferences and Device Characteristics to Enable UI Adaptability in Web 2.0 Applications','2014','0','','Abstract We present in this paper a tool that supports the collection of user preferences within the set of components developed in the i2web project to enable UI adaptability of web 2.0 applications.

Based on the language-independent model of Abstract State Services (AS 2 s), which serves as a universal integrated model for data and software as services, we extend AS 2 s by high-level action schemes called “plots” as a means to specify permitted sequences of service operations. On these grounds, we develop a model for service mediators, that is, specifications of composed services in which service slots have to be filled by actual services, and investigate matching conditions for slots of mediators and services. For a services to match a slot in a mediator, a (generalised) projection of the mediator must comply with the plot of the service.

The increasing complexity of dealing with a variety of authentication mechanisms often causes end users to develop negative security behaviours, such as writing down passwords.

A service developer plays the role that is responsible for constructing service compositions and the service provider is responsible for offering them to consumers of the Aniketos platform. Typically, service consumers will have different needs and requirements; they have varying business goals and different expectations from a service, for example in terms of functionality, quality of service and security needs. Given this, it is important to ensure that a service should deliver for which it has been selected and should match the consumer’s expectations. If it fails, the system should take appropriate subsequent reactions, e.g., notifications to the service consumer or service designer. In this chapter, we present the policy-driven monitoring framework which is developed as part of the Aniketos project. The monitoring framework allows different user-specified policies to be monitored simultaneously. The monitoring is performed at the business level, as well as at the implementation level, which allows for checking the policies of composite services as well as atomic ones. The framework sends an alarm in case of policy violation to notify the interested parties and triggers re-composition or re-configuration of the service.','',2,'Muhammad AsimArtsiom YautsiukhinAchim D.

In the literature, security against such attacks has been formalized via indistinguishability-based and simulation-based notions, respectively called IND-SO-CPA security and SIM-SO-CPA security. Furthermore, the IND-SO-CPA notion has been studied under two flavors – weak-IND-SO-CPA and full-IND-SO-CPA security. At Eurocrypt’09, Bellare et al. showed the first positive results on SOA security of encryption schemes: 1) any lossy encryption scheme is weak-IND-SO-CPA secure; 2) any lossy encryption scheme with efficient openability is SIM-SO--CPA secure. Despite rich further work on SOA security, the (un)feasibility of full--IND-SO-CPA remains a major open problem in the area of SOA security. The elusive nature of the full-IND-SO-CPA notion of security is attributed to a specific aspect of the security game, namely, the challenger requiring to perform a super-polynomial time task. Not only do we not know whether there exists a scheme that is full-IND-SO-CPA secure, but we also do not know concrete attacks against popular schemes such as the ElGamal and Cramer-Shoup schemes in the full-IND-SO-CPA model. The contribution of our work is three-fold. 1. Motivated by the difficulty in understanding (un)feasibility of the full-IND-SO-CPA notion, we study a variant of this notion that is closer in spirit to the IND-CPA notion but still embodies the security captured by the full-IND-SO-CPA notion. We observe that the weak form of our variation does not introduce any significant change to the weak-IND-SO-CPA notion; that is, the weak form of our notion is equivalent to the weak-IND-SO-CPA notion. 2. Interestingly, we can show that a large class of encryption schemes can be proven insecure for the full form of our notion. The large class includes most known constructions of weak-IND-SO-CPA secure schemes and SIM-SO-CPA secure schemes and also popular schemes like the ElGamal and Cramer-Shoup schemes. 3. Our third contribution studies the complexity of SIM-SO-CPA security. Complementing the result of Bellare et al., we show that lossiness is not necessary to achieve SIM-SO-CPA security. More specifically, we present a SIM-SO-CPA scheme that is not a lossy encryption scheme (regardless of efficient open ability). Since SIM-SO-CPA security implies weak-IND-SO-CPA security, it follows as a corollary that the converses of both the implications proved by Bellare et al. do not hold. Furthermore, as a corollary of our techniques, on a slightly unrelated but useful note, we obtain that lossiness is not required to obtain non-committing encryption. Previously, at Eurocrypt’09, Fehr et al. showed a construction of a non-committing encryption scheme from trapdoor permutations and this scheme was, as noted by the authors, possibly not lossy. Our scheme amounts to the first construction of a non-committing encryption scheme that is provably not lossy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.','',1,'Ostrovsky R., Rao V., Visconti I.','scopus/soa security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1635,'Context-aware dissemination of information and services in heterogeneous network environments','2014','4',' Context-awareness Context similarity Data dissemination Fuzzy MADM pervasive computing Service platform Quality of Information','Abstract The Internet of Things and the advent of cloud computing promotes a global scale Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication.

Context-awareness is a key ingredient in any ubiquitous and pervasive system and provides intelligence to the system, allowing computing devices make appropriate and timely decisions on behalf of users. Semantic support for M2M communication can be enhanced if it leverages the available information and contextual data.

We propose a fuzzy MADM method and a context similarity measure. The proposed method of information dissemination is based on mining the value of a node based on information inferred from the contextual information of the node and contextually similar nodes.

This, in turn, facilitates the online monitoring of system behaviors and the enforcement of allowed behaviors—all ingredients that can be used to assist compliance management on the fly during process execution. In this paper, instead of focusing on monitoring and runtime enforcement of rules or constraints, we strive for an alternative approach to compliance management in SOAs that aims at assessing and improving compliance. We propose two ingredients: (i) a model and tool to design compliant service-based processes and to instrument them in order to generate evidence of how they are executed and (ii) a reporting and analysis suite to create awareness of a company’s compliance state and to enable understanding why and where compliance violations have occurred. Together, these ingredients result in an approach that is close to how the real stakeholders—compliance experts and auditors—actually assess the state of compliance in practice and that is less intrusive than enforcing compliance.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Carlos RodríguezDaniel SchleicherFlorian DanielFabio CasatiFrank LeymannSebastian Wagner','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(1640,'Wireless Sensor Networks and Service-oriented Architecture, As Suitable Approaches to Be Applied into ITS','2012','0','ITS, SOA, WSN, intelligent transportation systems, navigation, parking systems, service-oriented architecture, web services, wireless sensors networks','In this paper, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approaches are analyzed given that represent both emerging and key role for Intelligent Transportations Systems (ITS).

Current data center networks (DCNs) suffer from several problems such as high-energy consumption, high latency, fixed throughput of links, and limited reconfigurability. Electronic switches are low radix and have high latency due to a large hop count since each hop employs a store-and-forward mechanism. Optical interconnects, on the other hand, offer several advantages such as low-energy consumption, high bandwidth, reconfigurability, malleability to changing traffic, high-radix switch design, fast switching transition times, and wavelength multiplexing. These benefits provide the incentive to shift from electrical interconnects to optical interconnects in DCNs. Despite several advantages over their electrical counterparts, the performance of optical interconnects can be further improved by considering some performance parameters of optical interconnects. One such important parameter for the performance of any communication network is the blocking probability. This paper makes a comprehensive investigation of the performance of optical interconnects in different DCN architectures on the basis of blocking probability and concludes by suggesting ways to reduce the blocking.','Photonic Network Communications',1,'Mohsin FayyazKhurram AzizGhulam Mujtaba','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(1652,'Acoustic environment identification using unsupervised learning','2014','1','','Abstract Acoustic environment leaves its characteristic signature in the audio recording captured in it.

One of the challenges raised by the WoT is the in-network continuous processing of data streams presented by Things, which must be investigated urgently because it affects the future data models of the IoT, and is critical regarding the scalability and the sustainability required by the IoT. This cross-cutting concern has been previously studied in the context of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) given the focus on the acquisition and in-network processing of sensed data. However, proposed solutions feature various proprietary and highly specialized technologies that are difficult to integrate and complex to use, which represents a hurdle to their wide deployment. At the other end of the spectrum, cloud-based solutions introduce a too high energy cost for the envisioned IoT scale, considering the energy cost of communication over computation. There is thus a need for a distributed middleware solution for data stream management that leverages existing WSN work, while integrating it with today’s Web technologies in order to support the required flexibility and the interoperability of the IoT. Toward that goal, this paper introduces Dioptase , a lightweight Data Stream Management System for the WoT, which aims to integrate the Things and their streams into today’s Web by presenting sensors and actuators as Web services. The middleware specifically provides a way to describe complex fully-distributed stream-based mashups and to deploy them dynamically, at any time, as task graphs, over available Things of the network, including resource-constrained ones.','Journal of Internet Services and Applications',1,'Benjamin BilletValérie Issarny','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1655,'Evolution and Revolution in Knowledge-Driven Health IT: A 50-Year Perspective and a Look Ahead','2015','0','','Abstract In this keynote presentation, my intent is to explore the evolution of the field of computer-based clinical decision support (CDS) – and its associated tasks of knowledge acquisition, knowledge modeling, knowledge representation, knowledge management, and knowledge integration into care processes – over the past five decades.

However, it extends the basic data model of trajectory with new patterns as the space-time path to describe activities of the moving object and the composite region of interest.

However, WSN s are resource constraint, and have limited computation abilities, limited communication bandwidth and especially limited energy. Fortunately, sensor nodes in WSN s are usually deployed redundantly, which brings the opportunity to adopt a sleep schedule for balanced energy consumption to extend the network lifetime. Due to miniaturization and energy efficiency, one sensor node can integrate several sense units and support a variety of services. Traditional sleep schedule considers only the constraints from the sensor nodes, can be categorized to a one-layer (i.e., node layer) issue. The service oriented WSN s should resolve the energy optimization issue considering the two-layer constraints, i.e., the sensor nodes layer and service layer. Then, the one-layer energy optimization scheme in previous work is not applicable for service oriented WSN s. Hence, in this paper we propose a sleep schedule with a service coverage guarantee in WSN s. Firstly, by considering the redundancy degree on both the service level and the node level, we can get an accurate redundancy degree of one sensor node. Then, we can adopt fuzzy logic to integrate the redundancy degree, reliability and energy to get a sleep factor. Based on the sleep factor, we furthermore propose the sleep mechanism.

Results: Regarding the architectural decision-making process, the findings are in line with previous empirical studies, showing that most of the companies are not using well-known academic approaches such as ATAM, they are rather using their own procedures. The study also shows that the relationships among the actors of a software ecosystem could significantly affect the architectural-decision making process in each of the actors, for example, by limiting their alternative solutions. Finally, the results confirm that it is advantageous for the enterprises to reuse the architectural decisions across their various projects or for cooperative companies to reuse the decisions across their similar projects.

In VCC, vehicles act as the intelligent machines which can be used to collect and transfer the healthcare data to the local, or global sites for storage, and computation purposes, as vehicles are having comparatively limited storage and computation power for handling the multimedia files. However, due to the dynamic changes in topology, and lack of centralized monitoring points, this information can be altered, or misused. These security breaches can result in disastrous consequences such as-loss of life or financial frauds. Therefore, to address these issues, a learning automata-assisted distributive intrusion detection system is designed based on clustering. Although there exist a number of applications where the proposed scheme can be applied but, we have taken multimedia-based healthcare application for illustration of the proposed scheme. In the proposed scheme, learning automata (LA) are assumed to be stationed on the vehicles which take clustering decisions intelligently and select one of the members of the group as a cluster-head. The cluster-heads then assist in efficient storage and dissemination of information through a cloud-based infrastructure. To secure the proposed scheme from malicious activities, standard cryptographic technique is used in which the auotmaton learns from the environment and takes adaptive decisions for identification of any malicious activity in the network. A reward and penalty is given by the stochastic environment where an automaton performs its actions so that it updates its action probability vector after getting the reinforcement signal from the environment. The proposed scheme was evaluated using extensive simulations on ns-2 with SUMO. The results obtained indicate that the proposed scheme yields an improvement of 10  % in detection rate of malicious nodes when compared with the existing schemes.','Cluster Computing',1,'Neeraj KumarJaskaran Preet SinghRasmeet S.

The rapid growth of social networks has given a rise to a new kind of systems, which have been termed “social recommender service”. In this context, a software as a service recommender system can be utilized to extract a set of suitable referrals for certain users based on the data collected from the personal profiles of other end-users within a social structure. However, preserving end-users privacy in social recommender services is a very challenging problem that might prevent privacy concerned users from releasing their own profiles’ data or to be forced to release an erroneous data. Thus, both cases can detain the accuracy of extracted referrals. So in order to gain accurate referrals, the social recommender service should have the ability to preserve the privacy of end-users registered in their system. In this paper, we present a middleware that runs on the end-users’ side in order to conceal their profiles data when being released for the recommendation purposes. The computation of recommendation proceeds over this concealed data. The proposed middleware is equipped with a distributed data collection protocol along with two stage concealment process to give the end-users complete control over the privacy of their profiles. We will present an IPTV network scenario along with the proposed middleware. A number of different experiments were performed on real data which was concealed using our two stage concealment process to evaluate the achieved privacy and accuracy of the extracted referrals. As supported by the experiments, the proposed framework maintains the recommendations accuracy with a reasonable privacy level.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',1,'Ahmed M.

Further, how the telecom industry can leverage IoS research and push IoS capabilities on and beyond through innovation and how those services within the IoS should be designed and implemented need to be understood. Not only are these questions answered but also so as not to remain stationary in the world of IoS, the telecoms industry must comprehend the upcoming challenges and opportunities that the IoS will present. Within this chapter there are two perspectives taken on the more specific aspects of engineering services for the IoS. The first takes a first principles approach whereas the second takes one from the basis of an innovative methodology. This chapter will provide information and insights that seek to answer the former questions, starting with a discussion on what exactly a service is, moving through the innovation, design and implementation of IoS and its services, and finally arriving at a demonstrator of IoS that points towards its own future.','',2,'Javier SorianoChristoph HeitzHans-Peter HutterRafael FernándezJuan J.

One of the most important aspects which differentiate a cloud workflow system from its other counterparts is the market-oriented business model. This is a significant innovation which brings many challenges to conventional workflow scheduling strategies. To investigate such an issue, this paper proposes a market-oriented hierarchical scheduling strategy in cloud workflow systems. Specifically, the service-level scheduling deals with the Task-to-Service assignment where tasks of individual workflow instances are mapped to cloud services in the global cloud markets based on their functional and non-functional QoS requirements; the task-level scheduling deals with the optimisation of the Task-to-VM (virtual machine) assignment in local cloud data centres where the overall running cost of cloud workflow systems will be minimised given the satisfaction of QoS constraints for individual tasks. Based on our hierarchical scheduling strategy, a package based random scheduling algorithm is presented as the candidate service-level scheduling algorithm and three representative metaheuristic based scheduling algorithms including genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimisation (ACO), and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) are adapted, implemented and analysed as the candidate task-level scheduling algorithms. The hierarchical scheduling strategy is being implemented in our SwinDeW-C cloud workflow system and demonstrating satisfactory performance. Meanwhile, the experimental results show that the overall performance of ACO based scheduling algorithm is better than others on three basic measurements: the optimisation rate on makespan, the optimisation rate on cost and the CPU time.','The Journal of Supercomputing',1,'Zhangjun WuXiao LiuZhiwei NiDong YuanYun Yang','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(1686,'Building sustainable parking lots with the Web of Things','2014','3',' Smart parking Sensor networks Web of Things Web services Semantic Web','Abstract Peak-time traffic woes create considerable amount of stress and environmental pollution resulting in an economic loss.

We present a scalable parking lot network infrastructure that exposes parking management operations through a judicious mashup of physical things’ services within a parking lot. Our system uses service-oriented architecture, allowing motorists to reserve parking spots in advance. In doing so, our proposed system leverages the use of HTTP and Wi-Fi for the Web enablement and interoperability of things within a parking spot and elevates it as a Smart Parking Spot on the Web. Our suggested semantic Web-based structure for representing things makes it possible to query physical things’ states and services depending on their capabilities and other relevant parking-related parameters. Our performance evaluation reveals that a maximum of 40 % time is saved to find parking spots and also 40 % reduction in air pollution is observed.','Personal and Ubiquitous Computing',1,'Sujith Samuel MathewYacine AtifQuan Z.

This growth is mostly due to the large number of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, with applications such as: industrial monitoring, home automation, and others. One common aspect with the majority of application areas is the lack of mobility. Most IoT devices are stationary and often use IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN solutions. When a high level of mobility is required, the use of IEEE 802.15.4 is not possible without adding additional hardware for the user to carry. In this article, a holistic network architecture consisting of heterogeneous devices is presented. The architecture is composed of Embedded Internet Systems (EIS) and uses standard communication protocols. One important feature is the use of the Service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm. The use of SOA, by utilization of the CoAP protocol and standard services, enables the proposed architecture to exchange sensor- and actuator data with an Internet-based cloud as well as a user\'s local cloud consisting of sensor IoT devices, smart phones and laptops. Another component of the architecture is a web-based human-machine interface for configuration, monitoring and visualization of sensor and actuator data using emerging web technologies for structured data processing. Results from experiments and real-world tests show that the proposed architecture can support sample rates of up to several kHz while enabling sensor data to be transmitted to SOA services in real time. This proves that the use of SOA, and Restful web services in particular, is feasible on resource-constrained platforms while supporting true mobility.','Service Oriented System Engineering (SOSE), 2013 IEEE 7th International Symposium on',1,'P.

Open system integration paradigms, such as service oriented architecture (SOA) and enterprise service bus (ESB), have provided answers to the interoperability requirement. However, when it comes to integrating systems featuring heterogeneous interaction paradigms, such as client-service, publish-subscribe and tuple space, existing solutions are typically ad hoc and partial, applying to specific interaction protocol technologies. In this paper, we introduce an interoperability solution based on abstraction and merging of the common high-level semantics of interaction paradigms, which is sufficiently general and extensible to accommodate many different protocol technologies.

It has been reported that it reduces the costs as well as ensures the long-term sustainability of software systems. Monolithic software systems are seen as a set of interrelated and geographically distributed services over the Internet. Developers and providers can easily customize services while being able to accommodate a large range of stakeholders. At the core of this service orientation of the whole field of software development are the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) design principles. These principles detail what we should do, but not how and by whom it has to be done. From a human perspective -- all stakeholders -- we argue that the current SOA design principles can be linked and benefit from the user experience/user-centric design. Such combination can lead to a user experience-centric and SOA-based design approach that guarantees that SaaS is secure, yet trustable, useful, usable and accessible. In this position paper, we reviewed SOA/SaaS from the human dimension with the goal to bridging the gaps between SOA design principles and the User Experience (UX) design communities including Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and service design.

Nowadays, enterprises are able to outsource their internal business processes as services and make them accessible via the Web. Then they can dynamically combine individual services to provide new value-added services. With the increasing number of web services having equivalent functionality, the binding procedure is driven by some non-functional, Quality of Service (QoS) criteria, such as the money cost, response time, reputation, reliability or a trade-off between them. Thus, an important problem is, given QoS constraints, how to aggregate and leverage individual service’s QoS information to derive the optimal QoS of the composite service. In this paper, we propose a novel QoS model for performing flexible service selection. The key idea of the model is to relax users’ QoS constraints and try to find the most possible services satisfying users’ QoS requirements. Based on the proposed QoS framework, we develop various algorithms for making service selection on individual and composite services. We also introduce a top- k ranking strategy to reflect a user’s personalized requirements. Experimental evaluation shows the proposed QoS model is efficient and practical.','World Wide Web',1,'Yanan HaoYanchun ZhangJinli Cao','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1695,'Dynamic carpooling mobility services based on secure multi-agent platform','2012','','Carpooling; Dynamic carpooling; Mobile authentication; Mobility services; Multi-Agent System; Service Oriented Architecture','Carpooling consists in sharing one\'s personal vehicles with one or several passengers in order to share the related costs but also reduce traffic and CO2 emissions.

Dynamic carpooling uses an IT system to remove this limitation and provide ways to react to events such as a traffic jam or to provide a precise evaluation of the cost of the trip for each of the involved actors. But it requires accessing potentially sensitive information such as the real time users\' position or their identity. As such, an efficient security mechanism should be implemented to protect data exchanged to provide the service but also to increase the users\' confidence in the tool.

Event matching seeks the subscriptions that match a given event from a subscription set, however, this work becomes increasingly complicated in content-based multi-attribute scenarios, where events and subscriptions are formed in content, and described by multiple attributes. In addition, large-scale systems are easier to suffer from severe degradation in event matching performance. To this end, this paper presents a high-efficiency content-based multi-attribute event matching algorithm, called HEM (hybrid event matching), which is hybridized by 2 different methods. In HEM, the matching on each single attribute (called single-attribute matching) is processed by a triangle-based matching method or a direct matching method dynamically. All single-attribute matchings are sorted via a fast near-optimal algorithm, and each of them is carried out sequentially. In this manner, the searching space of event matching shrinks gradually, so that the searching performance is boosted along with the process of event matching. Experiments are conducted to evaluate HEM comprehensively, where it is observed that HEM outperforms 3 state-of-the-art counterparts (TAMA, H-TREE and REIN) in main criteria, such as event matching time, insertion time and deletion time. Moreover, the gap of performance between HEM and the counterparts enlarges with the increase of system scale.','Science China Information Sciences',1,'Wenhao FanYuanan LiuBihua Tang','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(1698,'Advances in security and multimodality for pervasive computing environments','2013','0','','','Telecommunication Systems',1,'Jong Hyuk ParkChing-Hsien HsuNaveen ChilamkurtiMieso Denko','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1699,'Migration of an On-Premise Application to the Cloud: Experience Report','2013','1','','Abstract As of today it is still not clear how and when cloud computing should be used.

Though such practices offer advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and flexibility, those components are not immune to vulnerabilities. It is therefore important for the administrator of some composed service to evaluate the threats of such vulnerabilities accordingly within limited available information. Since almost all the existing efforts (e.g., CVSS) fail to consider specific context-aware information which is the specific character of SOA, they could not be adopted into SOA for scoring vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present VRank, a novel framework for the scoring and ranking of vulnerabilities in SOA. Different from existing efforts, for a given vulnerability, VRank not only considers its intrinsic properties (e.g., exploitability), but also takes into account the contexts of the services having this vulnerability, e.g., what roles they play in the composed service and how critical it is to the security objective of the service. The resulting scoring and ranking of vulnerabilities are thus highly relevant and meaningful to the composed service. We present the detailed design of VRank, and compare it with CVSS. Our experiments indicate VRank is able to provide much more useful ranking lists of vulnerabilities for complex composed services. © 2012 IEEE.','',1,'Jiang J., Ding L., Zhai E., Yu T.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1714,'Multi-agent peer-to-peer intrusion detection','2013','','','Ever increasing use of heterogeneous networks including mobile devices and ad-hoc sensor networks signifies the role of such information systems\' properties as openness, autonomy, cooperation, coordination, etc. Agent-based service-oriented Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture provides attractive (if not unique) design and implementation paradigm for such systems.

In the domain engineering phase, goal models guide the development of variability in SPLs by providing the rationale for the variability, while they are used for the configuration of SPLs in the application engineering phase. However, variability in SPLs, which is represented by feature models, usually has design and implementation-induced constraints. When those constraints are not aligned with variability in goal models, the configuration with goal models becomes error prone. To remedy this problem, we propose a description logic (DL)-based approach to represent both models and their relations in a common DL knowledge base. Moreover, we apply reasoning to detect inconsistencies in the variability of goal and feature models. A formal proof is provided to demonstrate the correctness of the reasoning approach.

Computational cloud is an attractive platform for computational offloading due to the attributes of scalability and availability of resources. Therefore, mobile cloud computing (MCC) leverages the application processing services of computational clouds for enabling computational-intensive and ubiquitous mobile applications on smart mobile devices (SMDs). Computational offloading frameworks focus on offloading intensive mobile applications at different granularity levels which involve resource-intensive mechanism of application profiling and partitioning at runtime. As a result, the energy consumption cost (ECC) and turnaround time of the application is increased. This paper proposes an active service migration (ASM) framework for computational offloading to cloud datacenters, which employs lightweight procedure for the deployment of runtime distributed platform. The proposed framework employs coarse granularity level and simple developmental and deployment procedures for computational offloading in MCC. ASM is evaluated by benchmarking prototype application on the Android devices in the real MCC environment. It is found that the turnaround time of the application reduces up to 45 % and ECC of the application reduces up to 33 % in ASM-based computational offloading as compared to traditional offloading techniques which shows the lightweight nature of the proposed framework for computational offloading.','The Journal of Supercomputing',1,'Muhammad ShirazAbdullah Gani','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(1723,'Towards a flexible and secure runtime for embedded devices','2014','','Embedded systems; Security; Service oriented architecture','Advancing towards the Internet of Things, a need for bigger connectivity between every time smaller embedded devices is foreseen.

A key idea of our approach, Positron, is that a protocol specifies the accountability of one role to another in addition to the requirements from each role. Specifically, Positron incorporates role accountability and role requirements as two integral aspects of protocol composition. In this way, it seeks to promote collaboration in STSs through natural requirements elicitation; flexibility enactment; and compliance and validation (ascribing accountability for each requirement to a specific role). Positron maps composite protocols to the representations of a well-known model checker as a way to verify protocols to assist in their correct formulation. We evaluate Positron by demonstrating it on real-life protocols.','',2,'Scott N. GerardPankaj R. TelangAnup K. KaliaMunindar P.

However, contextual information of the cloud consumer, which has not been deeply elaborated yet, may change at any time, which would significantly affect the Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, in this paper, our aim is to ameliorate SLA by considering the semantic meaning of SLA concepts and contextual information from cloud consumers. In this regard, we propose a new ontology-based context-aware SLA management for cloud computing. Our approach aims to dynamically adapt cloud services to different variations of consumer’s context while meeting their needs using the benefits of inference in ontology. This maintains a reliable QoS and respects the SLA parameters.

AIDeMaS has been implemented as part of FUSION@ a multi-agent architecture that facilitates the integration of distributed services and applications to optimize the construction of highly-dynamic multi-agent systems. One of the main features of AIDeMaS is that is employs case-based reasoning mechanisms, which provide it with great learning and adaptation capabilities that can be used for classifying SOAP messages.

This is effected by separating each frame into ROIs and representing the resulting subimages through feature vectors. By observing these vectors we can determine when there is action in a particular ROI. The second part of the framework lies in examining whether the detected activity corresponds to a workflow related event. This is accomplished by HMM modeling. Finally, the third part employs a string matching based technique to confirm the validity of the observed sequence of events or correct any detection or classification errors. This last step also addresses a top down approach by informing lower system levels (such as image representation or object tracking) about the errors committed. The performance of the proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated under real-life complex visual workflow understanding scenarios, in an industrial plant.

The adaptability in this proposed architecture is achieved by enabling the service providers to Monitor, Analyze and Act on the defined policies that support customization of compositions of multimedia services and guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning. The Media Service Monitor (MSM) observes the business and quality metrics associated with the multimedia services during run-time. The monitored results are analyzed by Monitored Results Analyzer (MRA) which identifies the type and location of the fault. The Adaptive Media Service Manager (AMSM) takes corrective actions based on the monitored results, through the policies defined as an extension of WS-Policy (Web Service—Policy framework). The effectiveness of the proposed Self-Adaptable Media Service Architecture (SAMSA) has been evaluated on Dynamic Composite Real-time Video-on-Demand Web Service (DCRVoDWS) for a maximum of 200 simultaneous client’s requests. The analysis of results shows that the proposed architecture provides better improvement on reliability, response time and user satisfaction.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',2,'G.

On the Internet, apart from techniques for data/knowledge management, BI Web applications need interfaces with a high level of interoperability (similar to the traditional desktop interfaces) for the visualisation of data/knowledge. In some cases, this has been provided by Rich Internet Applications (RIA). The development of these BI RIAs is a process traditionally performed manually and, given the complexity of the final application, it is a process which might be prone to errors. The application of model-driven engineering techniques can reduce the cost of development and maintenance (in terms of time and resources) of these applications, as they demonstrated by other types of Web applications. In the light of these issues, the paper introduces the S m 4RIA-B methodology, i.e., a model-driven methodology for the development of RIA as BI Web applications. In order to overcome the limitations of RIA regarding knowledge management from the Web, this paper also presents a new RIA platform for BI, called RI@BI, which extends the functionalities of traditional RIAs by means of Semantic Web technologies and B2B techniques.

Heterogeneous interactions can be abstractly represented by client-service , publish-subscribe and tuple space middleware connectors that are interconnected via bridging mechanisms providing interoperability among the services. In this paper, we make use of the eXtensible Service Bus (XSB), proposed in the CHOReOS project as the connector enabling interoperability among heterogeneous choreography participants. XSB models transactions among peers through generic post and get operations that represent peer behavior with varying time/space coupling. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous lease and timeout constraints of these operations severely affect latency and success rates of transactions. By precisely studying the related timing thresholds using timed automata models, we verify conditions for successful transactions with XSB connectors. Furthermore, we statistically analyze through simulations, the effect of varying lease and timeout periods to ensure higher probabilities of successful transactions. Simulation experiments are compared with experiments run on the XSB implementation testbed to evaluate the accuracy of results. This work can provide application developers with precise design time information when setting these timing thresholds in order to ensure accurate runtime behavior.','',1,'Ajay KattepurNikolaos GeorgantasGeorgios BouloukakisValérie Issarny','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(1781,'Prototype for design-time secure and trustworthy service composition','2013','2','Security Policy; Security Verification; Service Composition; Service Oriented Architectures','Service-oriented environments provide the opportunity for services from different providers to work together, forming new composite services via composition of existing services.

Indeed, finding the relevant sensors and actuators, and combining them in a proper way in order to achieve a specific goal is not an easy task and requires several skills from different stakeholders. Moreover, sensor environments are inherently highly dynamic. Furthermore, current applications are in general tightly coupled to the underlying infrastructure which hampers their reuse and flexibility to changes. In this paper, we present a process-oriented and service-based approach for supporting the development of adaptive sensorbased applications. Our approach decouples application logic from its implementation. A designtime model is first specified, as a flow of activities, which is then deployed in a particular environment. Decoupling the application logic from its implementation enables, on one hand, to foster the reuse at the application level and, on the other hand, to adapt the same application to different environments and situations. We propose also an activity recommendation technique to provide assistance to application designers by recommending to them activities that have been used in a similar compositional context.

While the attributes of the database table only describe data and certain notions from the database relational schema, they do not describe the higher-level concepts or the knowledge from the domain that are commonly thought of and referred by engineers who need to inspect and manage the infrastructure with a holistic viewpoint. Thus, engineers have to work with rudimentary data-level attributes that, further, complicates the critical infrastructure management, which essentially needs efficient, effective, and informed decision making. Ontology enables to solve a complex problem where the underlying domain concept provides collective understanding of the data based on the domain knowledge from multi-dimensional resources. Enhanced domain knowledge modeling is applied for transportation infrastructure asset management that requires bridge inspectors to make decisions based on complex multi-layered heterogeneous data, such as, infrared image data, aerial photo data, ground-mounted LIDAR data, etc. The ontological concepts represent the process knowledge and assessment knowledge and it will be further used to support the bridge inspectors and their inspection process, whereas data are the ground facts. This process knowledge plays an important role to bridge the ground facts and the high-level concept space and provides the mapping of the complex data space to the easily comprehensible conceptual space.

We implemented a cloud-assisted video surveillance prototype to show how the proposed method can handle ubiquitous access to target video for possible QoS-adaptive and video processing requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, and frame rates.

Current compliance checking techniques are mostly focused on checking the control-flow perspective of business processes. This paper presents an approach for checking the compliance of observed process executions taking into account data, resources, and control-flow. Unlike the majority of conformance checking approaches we do not restrict the focus to the ordering of activities (i.e., control-flow). We show a collection of typical data and resource-aware compliance rules together with some domain specific rules. Moreover providing diagnostics and insight about the deviations is often neglected in current compliance checking techniques. We use control-flow and data-flow alignment to check compliance of processes and combine diagnostics obtained from both techniques to show deviations from prescribed behavior. Furthermore we also indicate the severity of observed deviations. This approach integrates with two existing approaches for control-flow and temporal compliance checking, allowing for multi-perspective diagnostic information in case of compliance violations. We have implemented our techniques and show their feasibility by checking compliance of synthetic and real life event logs with resource and data-aware compliance rules.','',2,'Elham Ramezani TaghiabadiVladimir GromovDirk FahlandWilM.

The objectives of this article are to investigate regression testing strategies in agile development teams and identify the factors that can influence the adoption and implementation of this practice. We have used a mixed methods approach to our research, beginning with an analysis of the literature to identify research themes related to the adoption of regression testing techniques under agile methodologies, from which we developed an analytical framework for the study. This was followed by three exploratory case studies that we used to exercise the main elements of the framework, develop some key themes of interest, and devise a questionnaire for the final stage of the study, an on-line survey to explore the main issues identified in the case studies across different contexts. Within our specific sample, our results suggest that organizational maturity is a key factor in effective regression testing practices and that the adoption of such practices is helped by a coherent testing philosophy and change management processes. We also found that the return on investment in automated regression testing was positive for our respondents and that adopting these practices in the context of agile methods had been a relatively painless process for the organizations in our survey. We conclude that investing in regression testing tools and processes is likely to be beneficial for organizations. However, further work is needed in assessing how organizational culture impacts on the quality process and the financial outcomes for commercial software development organizations.','Software Quality Journal',1,'David ParsonsTeo SusnjakManfred Lange','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1820,'Service Automata','2012','1','','Abstract We propose a novel framework for reliably enforcing security in distributed systems.

The on-demand and per-use cloud computing model, specifically that of public Cloud Infrastructure Service Offerings (CISOs), has quickly evolved and adopted by majority of hardware and software computing companies with the promise of provisioning utility-like computing resources at massive economies of scale. However, deploying business applications on public cloud infrastructure does not lead to achieving desired economics and elasticity gains, and some challenges block the way for realizing its real benefits.

We present our research on a new cross-tier partitioning approach to help developers make effective trade-offs between performance and cost in a hybrid cloud deployment. The general approach primarily benefits from two technical improvements to integer-programming based application partitioning. First, an asymmetric cost-model for optimizing data transfer in environments where ingress and egress data-transfer have differing costs, such as in many infrastructure as a service platforms.

SCA is supported by major software vendors due to its several advantages, such as technology independence and portability. However, SCA in its current form does not address components substitutability, one of the goals of the Service-Oriented Architectures style. This paper discusses this limitation and proposes a set of extensions to SCA in order to manage dynamic substitutability of services and their life cycle, which allows components to change service providers at run-time whenever they need to.

A widely used approach in practice is to introduce an intermediate integration layer for hiding the complexity and heterogeneity of the integrated systems or platforms. However, existing approaches introduce limited support for the flexibility of the integration architecture. It is challenging to alter the integration architecture, e.g., due to some exceptions or unanticipated situations such as peak loads or emergencies, because of rigid dependency structures in the integration architecture defined at design or deployment time. In this paper, we propose DERA as a novel approach that exploits event-driven architecture concepts for enhancing the flexibility and scalability of service-based integration architectures. Our approach provides primitive concepts that can easily be analyzed with tools or be used to depict a current snapshot of the integration architecture using graphical notations close to the intuitive perception of stakeholders.

Various techniques are proposed to discover process models reflecting real-life behaviors from these logs. However, the discovered models are mostly in Petri nets rather than BPMN models, the current industrial process modeling standard. Conforti et al. and Weber et al. propose techniques that discover BPMN models with sub-processes, multi-instance, etc. However, these techniques are made for event logs with special attributes, e.g., containing attributes about primary and foreign keys, which may not commonly appear in event logs. For example, logs from the OA (office automation) systems of CMCC (China Mobile Communications Corporation) do not contain such data. To solve this issue, this paper proposes two techniques that can discover BPMN models with sub-processes and multi-instance markers with event logs containing less event attributes. One of our techniques only requires four event attributes: case id, task name, start time and end time. Experimental evaluations with both real-life logs and synthetic logs show that our techniques can indeed discover process models with sub-process and multi-instance markers from logs with less event attributes, and are more accurate and less complex than those derived with flat process model discovery techniques.','',2,'Yuquan WangLijie WenZhiqiang YanBo SunJianmin Wang','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1842,'Successful CyberInfrastructures for E-Health','2014','','Agile Processes; CyberInfrastructure; Design Methodology; Distributed Systems; E-Health; Large-scale Systems; Security; Service-oriented Architecture; System Architecture','The health-care sector has stringent needs for CyberInfrastructures (CIs) to improve both its patient-care capabilities and its potential for advanced clinical research.

Given the ambitious goals of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) by 2020 and beyond, RDRs must be designed with the agility to evolve and efficiently interoperate in an ever changing rare disease landscape, as well as to cater for rapid changes in Information Communication Technologies. In this paper, we contend that RDR requirements will also evolve in response to a number of factors such as changing disease definitions and diagnostic criteria, the requirement to integrate patient/disease information from advances in either biotechnology and/or phenotypying approaches, as well as the need to adapt dynamically to security and privacy concerns. We dispel a number of myths in RDR development, outline key criteria for robust and sustainable RDR implementation and introduce the concept of a RDR Checklist to guide future RDR development.','Source Code for Biology and Medicine',1,'Matthew BellgardChristophe BeroudKay ParkinsonTess HarrisSegolene AymeGareth BaynamTarun WeeramanthriHugh DawkinsAdam Hunter','springer/webservice security.csv','springer','\0'),(1864,'Content Based Service Discovery in Semantic Web Services Using WordNet','2012','0',' Semantic Web Services Discovery Ontology Discovery WordNet','Abstract The main aspect of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is the ability to automatically discover and invoke web services. In web services the syntactic nature of the WSDL forced UDDI to feature only keyword-based matches that often leads to the discovery of more irrelevant services, which ultimately reduce the precision and recall of the search. Semantic web services had been proposed to overcome the issues such as interface heterogeneity and keyword-based syntactic search. The service discovery methods in semantic web services generally require a user query which is used to match the Inputs, Outputs, Precondition and Effect (IOPE) present in the service profile of the OWL-S. This type of matching restricts the users to use the queries that must be of the same context as that of the IOPEs present in the OWL-S. In this work a content-based semantic discovery architecture is proposed, in which the users can use their desired text document as input. The text document after passing through several refinement processes, the nouns are separated. This approach uses the WordNet lexical database, to find the meaning of the extracted nouns which are used for the discovery.','',1,'D. PaulrajS.

In recent years we have researched the engineering of self-adaptive software systems in three rather diverse domains: ubiquitous computing applications, teams of autonomous mobile robots, and management of service-oriented software systems. While all of them perform dynamic adaptation at run-time following a specified control loop, they differ fundamentally in their specific objectives, requirements, properties, and constraints. Consequently, their design and realization focus on different domain aspects and require different modeling and engineering techniques. In this paper we elaborate on synergies and discrepancies in developing the three case studies. We evaluate these self-adaptive systems using a recently published framework for evaluating self-adaptive software systems.

At present mostly Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) is used for publishing and discovery of multimedia web services providing a key word based search for the user. The web service standards used for delivering the multimedia streaming objects is also not sufficient due to very large object size and also the processing and delivering continuous stream of large scale data is difficult and time consuming to variety of client devices. This paper describes about the Service Oriented Architecture, in using an efficient querying mechanism which is specified in an extension of WSDL using the multimedia content metadata and its descriptions for querying the best service. Transmission of streaming data requires a message exchange protocol (MEP) to be defined and then implement the MEP in their SOAP HTTP bindings of the web service. Processing the demand for non functional requirements such as efficiency and security in streaming increases and the performance of SOAP is impacted by XML processing and communication overheads. To overcome these we go for various compression schemes for SOAP messages, so that the transfer overhead is reduced. By the new querying mechanism the efficiency of finding services can be improved as irrelevant data can be eliminated and by creating the MEP, efficiency is increased in terms of resource consumption. © 2014 IEEE.','',1,'Gerald Christopher Isaac S., Uma Devi V.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1878,'Modeling Business Capabilities and Context Dependent Delivery by Cloud Services','2013','2',' Model-Driven Development Capability Context Cloud Computing Enterprise Modeling','Abstract Contemporary business environments are changing rapidly, organizations are global, and cloud-based services have become a norm.

TaaS will transform current Army training applications into distributed webbased services, allowing them to be accessible across any location via thin client workstations and wireless mobile devices. The motivation behind this migration is coming from the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture Guidance published by the U.S. Army Chief Information Officer and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. In order to achieve the COE objectives, the Army recently launched a pilot study on the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA).

This paper describes the migration of CTIA to TaaS using a specific set of modern computing technologies that will enable rapid delivery of training capabilities across servers, mobile devices, and heterogeneous platforms.

Nevertheless, the lack of central control and the existence of incentives for cheating lead to the necessity of defining mechanisms for identifying well-behaving WSANs. Reputation based solutions have been suggested in the literature in order to cope with these situations, but most of them were focused on finding a specific most trustworthy sensor, capable of provisioning a requested service. Our work, however, is oriented to provide a mobile user with an accurate reputation-based mechanism allowing her to select, amongst a set of available WSANs, the most reputable one, according to the recommendations given by other users. Thus, the mobile user can build her own opinion and consequently decide which is the best WSAN to interact with. This decision will be based in her own criteria, which might be different from other users of the same service. In order to prevent the abuse of the proposed reputation system, we suggest a mechanism avoiding multiple recommendations from the same user in a specific time frame. Additionally, we handle certain privacy issues by hiding the real identity of a user behind a group.

Clients (i.e., software agents acting on behalf of human users or service providers) implementing such complex applications typically search and integrate services on the basis of their functional requirements and of their trust in the service suppliers. A major issue in this scenario relates to the definition of an assurance technique allowing clients to select services on the basis of their nonfunctional requirements and increasing their confidence that the selected services will satisfy such requirements. In this article, we first present an assurance solution that focuses on security and supports a test-based security certification scheme for Web services. The certification scheme is driven by the security properties to be certified and relies upon a formal definition of the service model. The evidence supporting a certified property is computed using a model-based testing approach that, starting from the service model, automatically generates the test cases to be used in the service certification. We also define a set of indexes and metrics that evaluate the assurance level and the quality of the certification process. Finally, we present our evaluation toolkit and experimental results obtained applying our certification solution to a financial service implementing the Interactive Financial eXchange (IFX) standard.','',1,'','acm/soa security.csv','acm','\0'),(1897,'Quantitative Reduction in Communication Load for Energy Efficiency in WSN','2015','0',' Wireless sensor network (WSN) Query optimization In-network optimization Base-station optimization Epoch','Abstract WSN is a dynamic network of randomly deployed tiny sensor nodes to monitor the physical ambient conditions, healthcare services, military surveillance, movements and tracking of vehicles or other targets etc. Sensing generates continuous streams of data which are distributed throughout the network.

In response to queries injected into the network nodes communicate data among themselves or to the base-station. Communication traffic thus generated is highly energy consuming activity. It drains out limited energy available with a node thereby rendering it useless as replenishment of energy is not possible in most of the deployments therefore efficient use of energy is the main focus to prolong the life of a WSN.

Service-Oriented Architecture is the most commonly and effectively realized through web services, and their temporal collaboration commonly referred to as web service composition. In the present scenario, the most popular variant of composition is service orchestration. Orchestration is achieved through a centralized ‘ heavyweight ’ engine, the orchestrating agent, that makes the  deployment configuration a massive ‘ choke-point ’. The issue achieves significance when data and compute intensive scientific applications rely on such a centralized scheme. Lately, a lot of research efforts are put in to deploy a scientific application on the cloud, thereby provisioning resources elastically at runtime. In this paper, we aim at eliminating this central ‘choke’ point by presenting a model inspired from ‘ Membrane Computing ’ that executes a scientific workflow in a decentralized manner. The benefit of this paradigm comes from the natural process of autonomy, where each cell provision resources and execute process-steps on its own. The approach is devised keeping in mind, the feasibility of deployment on a cloud based infrastructure. To validate the model, a prototype is developed and real scientific workflows are executed in-house (with-in the Intranet). Moreover, the entire prototype is also deployed on a virtualized platform with software defined networking, thereby studying the effects of a low bandwidth environment, and dynamic provisioning of resources.','',2,'Tanveer AhmedRohit VermaMiroojin BakshiAbhishek Srivastava','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1903,'Design Management: A Collaborative Design Solution','2013','0',' Design Architecture Linked Data Design Management UML','Abstract Design is more important than ever as software systems continue to increase in complexity, become more distributed, expose multiple interfaces and have more integration points.

A business process can be seen as a flow of tasks that are orchestrated to accomplish well-defined goals such as goods production or services delivery. From an IT perspective, BPM is closely related to a business process automation approach carried out by use of IT standards and technologies, such as service-oriented architectures (SOAs) and Web Services. This paper specifically focuses on fully automated business processes that are defined and executed as orchestrations of software services. In a BPM context, the ability to predict at design time the business process behavior assumes a strategic relevance, both to early assess whether or not the business goals are achieved and to gain a competitive advantage. A business process is typically specified by use of Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), the standard language for the high-level description of business processes. Unfortunately, BPMN does not support the characterization of the business process in terms of nonfunctional or QoS properties, such as performance and reliability. To overcome such a limitation, this paper introduces Performability-enabled BPMN (PyBPMN), a lightweight BPMN extension for the specification of performance and reliability properties. PyBPMN enables the design time prediction of the business processes behavior, in terms of performance and reliability properties. Such prediction activity requires the use of models that are to be first built and then evaluated. In this respect, this work introduces a model-driven method that exploits PyBPMN to predict, at design time, the performance and the reliability of a business process, either to select the process configuration that provides the best behavior or to check if a given configuration satisfies the overall requirements. The proposed model-driven method that enacts the automated analysis of a business process behavior embraces the complete business process development cycle, from the specification phase down to the implementation phase. The paper also describes how the proposed model-driven method is implemented. The several model transformations at the core of the method have been implemented by use of QVT, and the standard language for specifying model transformations provided by OMG’s MDA. The availability of such automated model transformations allows business analysts to predict the process behavior with no extra effort and without being required to own specific skills of performance or reliability theory, as shown by use of an example application.','Software & Systems Modeling',2,'Paolo BocciarelliAndrea D’Ambrogio','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(1910,'Case study: From legacy to connectivity migrating industrial devices into the world of smart services','2014','5','','Europa has launched multiple initiatives and research projects to remain competitive in a globalized world and keep industry and manufacturing on-shore.

Business process models are used to enhance the efficiency of management and gain the control of (co)operations both within an organization and between business partners. Organizations, especially big enterprises, maintain thousands of process models and process models of the same category are with high similarity. For example, China Mobile Communication Corporation (CMCC) have more than 8000 processes in their office automation systems and the processes of the same business in different subsidiaries are with some variations. Therefore, to analyze and manage these similar process models, techniques are required to detect the differences between them. This paper focuses on detecting behavioral differences between process models. The current technique takes hours to compare the behaviors of two models in worst cases. Therefore, in this paper, an efficient technique is proposed by comparing dependency sets and trace sets of features in process models. Experiments show that the technique can detect behavioral differences between two models within seconds in worst cases, at least four orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques.','',2,'Zhiqiang YanYuquan WangLijie WenJianmin Wang','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(1912,'Multi-tenant web application framework architecture pattern','2015','','PaaS;SaaS;application framework;cloud computing;design pattern;multi-tenancy;software architecture;software design;web application;web application framework','Multi-tenancy is a key to successful and sustainable cloud-based systems.

Analysis of the techniques for injecting malicious code into NoSQL data stores provides examples of new NoSQL injections as well as Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, allowing attackers to bypass perimeter defenses such as firewalls. Analysis of the source of these vulnerabilities and present methodologies can mitigate such attacks.

Representational state transfer (REST) is an architectural style that has attracted attention in the SOA domain as it allows the development of Web services based on original principles of the World Wide Web. Unlike Web service specifications, which are based on Simple Object Access Protocol and Web Services Description Language, REST does not provide \'official\' standards to address non-functional requirements of services, such as security, reliability, and transaction control. The timestamp-based two-phase commit protocol for RESTful service (TS2PC4RS) algorithm specifies concurrency control of RESTful services during a transaction. An extension of the TS2PC4RS specifies the concurrency control of the Web services considering the update operation to meet some business rules. However, neither algorithm addresses transaction control when failures occur. In long-term transactions, failures can occur and compromise the success of Web service applications. Two common failures traditionally considered in the analysis of protocols are host and connection failures. The aim of this paper is to address fault tolerance for TS2PC4RS and its extension. A fault-tolerant protocol based on timeout and log records is proposed. The fault-tolerant protocol provides support for the host and connection failures that may occur during a transaction execution. The fault-tolerant mechanisms are used to meet the application domain business rules that guide the behavior of RESTful services. We describe the protocol using scenarios when failures occur.

At the core of WS technology lie a number of XML-based standards, such as the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), that have successfully ensured WS extensibility, transparency, and interoperability. Nonetheless, there is an increasing demand to enhance WS performance, which is severely impaired by XML\'s verbosity. SOAP communications produce considerable network traffic, making them unfit for distributed, loosely coupled, and heterogeneous computing environments such as the open Internet. Also, they introduce higher latency and processing delays than other technologies, like Java RMI and CORBA. WS research has recently focused on SOAP performance enhancement. Many approaches build on the observation that SOAP message exchange usually involves highly similar messages (those created by the same implementation usually have the same structure, and those sent from a server to multiple clients tend to show similarities in structure and content). Similarity evaluation and differential encoding have thus emerged as SOAP performance enhancement techniques. The main idea is to identify the common parts of SOAP messages, to be processed only once, avoiding a large amount of overhead. Other approaches investigate nontraditional processor architectures, including micro- and macrolevel parallel processing solutions, so as to further increase the processing rates of SOAP/XML software toolkits. This survey paper provides a concise, yet comprehensive review of the research efforts aimed at SOAP performance enhancement.

Hybrid cloud, an amalgamation of two or more public and/or private clouds, is gaining high popularity between users due to various reasons involving improved performance, flexible business operations, capacity expansion, optimized costs, and enhanced security. The efficient execution of fine-grained parallel applications onto hybrid cloud system becomes limited due to a number of factors. From the application point of view, it ranges from the dynamicity of the applications to their precedence and communication constraints while for the computational resources, it includes heterogeneity of processors and participating clouds with their interconnection topology. This work proposes a compile time hybrid cloud-based task duplication strategy to execute the fine-grained applications represented as directed acyclic graph (DAG) onto the hybrid cloud environment. The proposed strategy schedules the tasks based on a degree relative to the critical path in the DAG and tries to achieve lower bound of the DAG. Furthermore, it makes an effort to avoid redundant duplication by duplicating only the required parent tasks considering the available idle slots to minimize the execution time of the application. The experimental study reveals that the proposed strategy performs better than its peers in terms of achieving the lower bound more efficiently with lesser degree of duplication for fine-grained jobs. The strategy is highly useful for cloud environment as it results in lower cost of usage of resources with enhanced system utilization.

Unfortunately, real-world processes rarely proceed that smoothly. A more complete analysis of a process requires that the process model also include details about what to do when exceptional situations arise. We have found that, in many cases, there are abstract patterns that capture the relationship between exception handling tasks and the normative process. Just as object-oriented design patterns facilitate the development, documentation, and maintenance of object-oriented programs, we believe that process patterns can facilitate the development, documentation, and maintenance of process models. In this paper, we focus on the exception handling patterns that we have observed over many years of process modeling. We describe these patterns using three process modeling notations: UML 2.0 Activity Diagrams, BPMN, and Little-JIL.

In addition to these operations and traditional QoS, offered services need to implement different levels of intrusion tolerance. Indeed, intrusion tolerance has been recently presented as part of the defense-in-depth solution in order to enhance security resilience for services, as a complement to the traditional intrusion prevention and detection. While satisfying functional requirements, a service also exposes its attack surface via published operations, protocols, and accessible data as an adverse side effect, which makes it susceptible to exploitation by malicious actors. The resulting question is - how can services fulfill and maintain their intrusion tolerance QoS (IT-QoS) for security resilience and rapid recovery in the face of hostile attacks. In this paper, we propose an approach to tune a service so that its attackability can be controlled and the IT-QoS guaranteed despite the exposed attack surface. Our approach relies on Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance (SCIT), a recovery-based intrusion tolerance architecture combined with service-oriented programming constructs. A quantitative analysis using Semi-Markov Process modeling provides a mathematical foundation for compensating the expansion of a service\'s attack surface by tuning SCIT system parameters. © 2012 IEEE.','',1,'Nguyen Q.L., Sood A.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(1938,'The SERIES Virtual Database: Architecture and Implementation','2015','0','','Abstract The European scientific community is currently highly fragmented, with each laboratory holding experimental data, stored in some cases in a non-structured way.

Traditionally, confidence in the correctness of a system is gained through a variety of activities and processes performed at development time, such as design analysis and testing. In the presence of self-adaptation, however, some of the assurance tasks may need to be performed at runtime. This need calls for the development of techniques that enable continuous assurance throughout the software life cycle. Fundamental to the development of runtime assurance techniques is research into the use of models at runtime (M@RT). This chapter explores the state of the art for using M@RT to address the assurance of self-adaptive software systems. It defines what information can be captured by M@RT, specifically for the purpose of assurance, and puts this definition into the context of existing work. We then outline key research challenges for assurance at runtime and characterize assurance methods.

A demonstrator is prototyped and experimental results show that the proposed interface is context-aware, i.e. it successfully detects available appliances, adapts itself to the changes that occur in the user’s environment, and automatically informs the user about these changes. The results also show that the proposed interface is versatile and easy to use, i.e. the user can easily control multiple devices by means of a browser menu.

Correspondingly, the perceptual video quality is improved at certain degree for the video stream encoded by the SSIM-based RDO. However, for the MB with significant luminance change (due to the flashlight or sunshine change, etc.) but little structure change compared to the co-located MB in the referred frame, the SSIM-based RDO may select improper encoding mode (SKIP) which leads to uncomfortable visual experience. In this paper, involving the surrounding pixels of the current coding MB into the measurement of spacial texture quality degradation, the RDO which jointly considers the SSIM-based distortion and SSE-based distortion is proposed to improve H.264/AVC perceptual coding performance. The Lagrange multiplier in the proposed RDO is firstly derived at the frame level. Then, to make the Lagrange multiplier more adaptive to the specific video content, the Lagrange multiplier for each individual MB is refined based on the visual information theory. Experimental results show that the proposed perceptual RDO can select the optimal encoding mode which preserves as much structural information as possible with as little SSE-based distortion as possible, and that the perceptual quality of the encoded video is improved.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',1,'Pinghua ZhaoYanwei LiuJinxia LiuRuixiao YaoSong Ci','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(1955,'Design and implementation of a massively parallel ESB','2013','','distributed and delay insensitive applications; Enterprise Service Bus (ESB); massively parallel processing; multithreading','Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is an SOA-based software architecture for business application integration in distributed and heterogeneous environments.

At the core of WS technology lie a number of XML-based standards, such as the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), that have successfully ensured WS extensibility, transparency, and interoperability. Nonetheless, there is an increasing demand to enhance WS performance, which is severely impaired by XML\'s verbosity. SOAP communications produce considerable network traffic, making them unfit for distributed, loosely coupled, and heterogeneous computing environments such as the open Internet. Also, they introduce higher latency and processing delays than other technologies, like Java RMI and CORBA. WS research has recently focused on SOAP performance enhancement. Many approaches build on the observation that SOAP message exchange usually involves highly similar messages (those created by the same implementation usually have the same structure, and those sent from a server to multiple clients tend to show similarities in structure and content). Similarity evaluation and differential encoding have thus emerged as SOAP performance enhancement techniques. The main idea is to identify the common parts of SOAP messages, to be processed only once, avoiding a large amount of overhead. Other approaches investigate nontraditional processor architectures, including micro- and macrolevel parallel processing solutions, so as to further increase the processing rates of SOAP/XML software toolkits. This survey paper provides a concise, yet comprehensive review of the research efforts aimed at SOAP performance enhancement.

In the meantime, the authorities have still not been able to understand and use the power of crowd sourcing. In this paper, we present the design principles of a new Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS). We aim to eliminate the typical limitations of previous unsuccessful platforms, that have mostly failed due to conceptual design issues. We argue that two fundamental changes must exist in new PPGIS platforms: there is a shift from hierarchies to increased equal rights platforms; improved communication, more transparency, and bi-directionality. The role of the authority in former platforms was really an authoritarian role: having all the power and only partly knowing and controlling the entire platform. This is completely different from the crowd source platforms we know to be successful. So, one fundamental change is to diminish hierarchies and prevent people from hiding themselves behind the institution. The second major conceptual design issue is related to transparency and communication. While former platforms use mechanisms to prevent citizens from seeing each other’s participation, we aim to enable people to see the participation of others. That’s a fundamental feature in social networks. We will also design it to be a two-way communication platform. If citizens are requested to participate, the administration must use the same platform to communicate with them. Not only to provide feedback, but also to publish useful information for the citizen. In this paper we describe how social media meets our design principles. We decide to implement our case study, the “Fix my Street” application, on top of a social engine, to take advantage of all social media features. Two necessary extensions to the social engine are briefly described, to capture the core logic of our application.','',1,'António SilvaJorge Gustavo Rocha','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(1965,'Discovering Services','2013','0','','Abstract This tutorial paper presents an overview of existing approaches for service discovery and describes a service discovery framework that can support both static and dynamic service discovery.

We propose an enterprise modeling approach to bridge the business-level understanding of the enterprise with its representations in databases and data warehouses. The business intelligence model (BIM) offers concepts familiar to business decision making—such as goals, strategies, processes, situations, influences, and indicators. Unlike many enterprise models which are meant to be used to derive, manage, or align with IT system implementations, BIM aims to help business users organize and make sense of the vast amounts of data about the enterprise and its external environment. In this paper, we present core BIM concepts, focusing especially on reasoning about situations, influences, and indicators. Such reasoning supports strategic analysis of business objectives in light of current enterprise data, allowing analysts to explore scenarios and find alternative strategies. We describe how goal reasoning techniques from conceptual modeling and requirements engineering have been applied to BIM. Techniques are also provided to support reasoning with indicators linked to business metrics, including cases where specifications of indicators are incomplete.

To address this, the current paper presents a set of mutation operators that can be combined and defines the corresponding combinatorial strategies based on data perturbation and combinatorial testing. Based on this, multiple mutants can be injected at one time to help uncover interactive faults. To improve testing efficiency and effectiveness, a combinatorial testing approach focusing on Web service vulnerability is proposed: Firstly, initial test data are generated with perturbation techniques based on Web Services Description Language documents and Simple Object Access Protocol messages. Then, a combinatorial testing cases generation (CTCG) algorithm is used to generate the final combinatorial test data according to the proposed strategies. Furthermore, for some special Web services in which there is only one parameter or one method in service interface, a fuzzy mutation approach algorithm, as a complementary approach to CTCG, is also proposed. Finally, some testing experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in an integrated testing platform. The experiments show that proposed approaches are both feasible and effective: They can find more vulnerability faults than the traditional approaches.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Jinfu ChenQing LiChengying MaoDave ToweyYongzhao ZhanHuanhuan Wang','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(1975,'WALK: A Modular Testbed for Crowd Evacuation Simulation','2014','0',' Crowd simulation Multi-agent system Pedestrian evacuation','Abstract When large numbers of people gather in public spaces such as stadiums, railway stations, shopping centers and concert halls there is an increased risk of mass emergence and disasters.

However, these concepts often go unused in practice. The 2008/2009 economic crisis provided a strong, ongoing impulse for redesigning such information systems (IS). This article develops six guidelines for the conceptual design of environmental scanning systems that are more applicable than those specified by previous research. We start with literature research, which reveals three gaps in existing approaches. Then we develop design guidelines to fill these gaps with the help of “modern” IS. To address the lack of sound requirements analysis, our first design principle proposes 360-degree environmental scanning systems for executives and suggests how to select the most important scanning areas. Three further findings cover weaknesses in the IS model perspective, focusing on more effective implications of weak signals. In terms of method, we propose incorporating scanning results more closely into executives’ decision-making processes. Applying the design guidelines at a raw materials and engineering company, we arrive at a prototype we call the “corporate radar.” It includes an IS-based tree with economic value added at risk on top. The resulting lessons learned help to evaluate our findings and the research method presented here, as well provide concrete starting points for future research.','Information Systems and e-Business Management',1,'Jörg H.

Existing techniques for computing LTRs produce monolithic representations, that have dependencies over multiple components. Such representations do not allow for effective component selection and repair.

We then show how u LTR can be used to improve the design, monitoring and repair of component-based systems under time requirements.

Hybrid approaches have emerged, which utilise both enterprise and cloud domains in order to balance between the cost of service execution and the provided Quality of Service (QoS) for end users. This paper presents a migration, monitoring and load-balancing mechanism and architecture for scaling services between the enterprise and cloud domains during traffic peaks. The argued benefit of the proposal is the automation of the service-migration process and improvement of the QoS. A prototype system is presented as a proof of the conceptual architecture. The performance results in a hybrid cloud environment indicate that service implementation can be migrated and load can be balanced within 200 ms. Furthermore, the mechanism can improve the QoS for end users during traffic peaks.

In e-health, medical services in remote places which include rustic healthcare centres, ships, ambulances and home healthcare services can be supported through the applications of e-health services such as medical databases, electronic health data and the transferring of text, video, sound and images. Given this, a proposal has been made for a multiple service wireless networking with multiple sets of priorities. In relation to the terms of an acceptable QoS level by the customers of e-health services, prioritization is an important criterion in a multi-traffic network. The requirement for QoS in medical networking of wireless broadband has paved the way for bandwidth prerequisites and the live transmission or real-time medical applications.

Clients (i.e., software agents acting on behalf of human users or service providers) implementing such complex applications typically search and integrate services on the basis of their functional requirements and of their trust in the service suppliers. A major issue in this scenario relates to the definition of an assurance technique allowing clients to select services on the basis of their nonfunctional requirements and increasing their confidence that the selected services will satisfy such requirements. In this article, we first present an assurance solution that focuses on security and supports a test-based security certification scheme for Web services. The certification scheme is driven by the security properties to be certified and relies upon a formal definition of the service model. The evidence supporting a certified property is computed using a model-based testing approach that, starting from the service model, automatically generates the test cases to be used in the service certification. We also define a set of indexes and metrics that evaluate the assurance level and the quality of the certification process.

Consequently, picking the most appropriate events becomes increasingly difficult for end-users. This complexity of choice reinforces the necessity of filtering systems that assist users in finding and selecting relevant events. Whereas traditional filtering tools enable e.g. the use of keyword-based or filtered searches, innovative recommender systems draw on user ratings, preferences, and metadata describing the events. Existing collaborative recommendation techniques, developed for suggesting web-shop products or audio-visual content, have difficulties with sparse rating data and can not cope at all with event-specific restrictions like availability, time, and location. Moreover, aggregating, enriching, and distributing these events are additional requisites for an optimal communication channel. In this paper, we propose a highly-scalable event recommendation platform which considers event-specific characteristics. Personal suggestions are generated by an advanced collaborative filtering algorithm, which is more robust on sparse data by extending user profiles with presumable future consumptions. The events, which are described using an RDF/OWL representation of the EventsML-G2 standard, are categorized and enriched via smart indexing and open linked data sets. This metadata model enables additional content-based filters, which consider event-specific characteristics, on the recommendation list. The integration of these different functionalities is realized by a scalable and extendable bus architecture. Finally, focus group conversations were organized with external experts, cultural mediators, and potential end-users to evaluate the event distribution platform and investigate the possible added value of recommendations for cultural participation.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',2,'Toon De PessemierSam CoppensKristof GeebelenChris VleugelsStijn BannierErik MannensKris VanheckeLuc Martens','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(1997,'Autonomic intelligent cyber-sensor to support industrial control network awareness','2014','4','Autonomic computing; control systems; industrial ecosystems; Network security; service-oriented architecture','The proliferation of digital devices in a networked industrial ecosystem, along with an exponential growth in complexity and scope, has resulted in elevated security concerns and management complexity issues.

This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts.

The proposed framework aims to improve the regular ways of obtaining patients medical records separated in each hospital. For instance, if a particular patient has different medical records in different hospitals visited by that patient, our architecture focuses on the method by which data should be searched and retrieved efficiently from a database on the cloud from different hospitals by preprocessing the data in current hospital\'s and saving them in the database that resides on the cloud. Our system design is based on cloud computing service oriented architecture. Some of the information included in these medical records is: medical history, prescribed medications and allergies, immunization status, laboratory and test results, radiology images, personal stats like age and weight, diagnoses, order tests and appointments. All of these records are identified by the national ID of the patient. these systems will be utilized by web services asp.net based framework, the doctor will use his/her ID and password to enter the system for security and then enter the patient\'s ID to send a request for that patient\'s record that will be sent back to the doctor, the record will be up-to-date since the last visit of the patient to any hospital in Saudi Arabia.

Although changes might become necessary for various reasons, they can often not be kept local, i.e., at one partner’s side, but must be partly or entirely propagated to one or several other partners. Due to the autonomy of partners in a collaboration, change effects cannot be imposed on the partners, but must be agreed upon in a consensual way. In our model of this collective decision process, we assume that each partner that becomes involved in a negotiation has different alternatives on how a change may be realized, and evaluates these alternatives according to his or her individual costs and benefits (utilities). This paper presents models from group decision making that can be applied for handling change negotiations in process collaborations in an efficient and fair way. The theoretical models are evaluated based on a proof-of-concept prototype that integrates an existing implementation for change propagation in process collaborations with change alternatives, utility functions, and group decision models. Based on simulating a realistic setting, the validity of the approach is shown. Our prototype supports the selection of change alternatives for each partner during negotiation that depending on the group decision model used, provides solutions emphasizing efficiency and/or fairness.','',2,'Walid FdhilaConrad IndionoStefanie Rinderle-MaRudolf Vetschera','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(2008,'Service fault tolerance for highly reliable service-oriented systems: an overview','2015','1',' fault tolerance software reliability Web service SOA 关键词 容错 软件可靠性 网络服务 面向服务架构','Abstract Service-oriented systems are widely-employed in e-business, e-government, finance, management systems, and so on.

This paper evaluates if an Information Security Management System (ISMS), defined by the international standard ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 can be used to comprehensively support Information Security governance for SOA. As SOA governance, a separate and distinct governance framework, also addresses information security to a certain extent, managers are faced the difficult task of deciding whether their SOA sufficiently protected by the different frameworks. The conclusion is that information security for SOA needs to be addressed more holistically, following an Enterprise Information Security Architecture (EISA) approach where Enterprise Architecture (EA) is concerned with the design of the overall architectural vision of an organization. The framework chosen for this purpose is SABSA, a well-known enterprise security architecture. Using the example of access control to highlight challenges, it becomes clear that Information Security governance for SOA can benefit from an approach such as SABSA.','Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES), 2012 Seventh International Conference on',1,'M.

Several approaches, using both static and dynamic credit-based strategies, have been developed to enforce the rate specified in the CSC.

We propose a mechanism for automatic processing of these formal policy definitions in a TOSCA runtime environment that we have developed based on the proposed architecture of the TOSCA primer. In order to evaluate our approach, we present prototypical implementations of security policies for encrypting databases and for limiting the geographical location of the Cloud servers.

The outsourcing however does not allow data owners to outsource the responsibility of confidentiality, integrity and access control, as it still is the responsibility of the data owner. As cloud computing is transparent to both the programmers and the users, it induces challenges that were not present in previous forms of distributed computing. Furthermore, cloud computing enables its users to abstract away from low-level configuration such as configuring IP addresses and routers. It creates an illusion that this entire configuration is automated. This illusion is also true for security services, for instance automating security policies and access control in cloud, so that individuals or end-users using the cloud only perform very high-level (business oriented) configuration. This paper investigates the security challenges posed by the transparency of distribution, abstraction of configuration and automation of services by performing a detailed threat analysis of cloud computing across its different deployment scenarios (private, bursting, federation or multi-clouds).

However, there is little practical guidance on how to organize and coordinate the multiple lines of work that developing, or modernizing to, a service-oriented portfolio entails. We outline a method framework that uses the structure of a service-oriented taxonomy of capabilities to organize requirements and development in terms of elaboration and refinement of requirements. The method compiles several best practices and supports independent, but integral, lines of work that can be organized in small-scale projects. We illustrate the framework on three cases that involve computer- and simulation-assisted business processes. We conclude that service-oriented capability taxonomies can be used to structure and discipline requirements handling at all levels, from enterprise strategy to technical systems. We suggest that our framework supports the development of capabilities and services that are persistent in the service-oriented sense relative to each other and to implementation. We suggest further that the framework supports collaborative work by facilitating shared conceptions across lines of work.

Services are commonly regarded as black boxes with well-defined interfaces that can be recursively aggregated into new services. The black-box nature of services does not only include the service implementation but also implies the use of middleware and hardware to run the services. Thus, service composition techniques are typically limited to choosing between a set of available services. In this paper, we keep the black-box nature and the principle of information hiding of services, but in addition we break up services vertically . By introducing vertical service composition , we allow services to be provisioned on demand using the middleware and runtime environment that specifically meets user-required quality of services. Therefore, a service is setup individually for services requestors instead of providing them with a pre-determined list of available services to choose from. We introduce the concept of vertical service composition and present an extension to an enterprise service bus that implements the concept of vertical service composition by combining concepts from provisioning with those of (dynamic) service binding.','Service Oriented Computing and Applications',1,'Ralph RetterChristoph FehlingDimka KarastoyanovaFrank LeymannDaniel Schleicher','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(2058,'2013 Military Communications and Information Systems Conference, MilCIS 2013 - Proceedings','2013','','','The proceedings contain 7 papers.

BI faces sophisticated security issues given its strategic importance for higher management of business entities. Scholars have emphasized on enhanced session, presentation and application layer security in BI, in addition to the usual network and transport layer security controls. This is because an unauthorized user can gain access to highly sensitive consolidated business information in a BI system. To protect a BI environment, a number of controls are needed at the level of database objects, application files, and the underlying servers. In a cloud environment, the controls will be needed at all the components employed in the service-oriented architecture for hosting BI on the cloud. Hence, a BI environment (whether self-hosted or cloud-hosted) is expected to face significant security overheads. In this context, two models for securing BI on a cloud have been simulated in this paper. The first model is based on securing BI using a Unified Threat Management (UTM) cloud and the second model is based on distributed security controls embedded within the BI server arrays deployed throughout the Cloud. The simulation results revealed that the UTM model is expected to cause more overheads and bottlenecks per OLAP user than the distributed security model. However, the distributed security model is expected to pose administrative control effectiveness challenges than the UTM model. Based on the simulation results, it is recommended that BI security model on a Cloud should comprise of network, transport, session and presentation layers of security controls through UTM, and application layer security through the distributed security components. A mixed environment of both the models will ensure technical soundness of security controls, better security processes, - learly defined roles and accountabilities, and effectiveness of controls.','Service Oriented System Engineering (SOSE), 2013 IEEE 7th International Symposium on',1,'H.

However, SOA introduces new security challenges not present in the single-hop client-server architectures due to the involvement of multiple service providers in a service request. The interactions of independent service domains in SOA could violate service policies or SLAs. In addition, users in SOA systems have no control on what happens in the chain of service invocations. Although the establishment of trust across all involved partners is required as a prerequisite to ensure secure interactions, still a new end-to-end security auditing mechanism is needed to verify the actual service invocations and its conformance to the expected service orchestration. In this paper, we provide an efficient solution for end-to-end security auditing in SOA. The proposed security architecture introduces two new components called taint analysis and trust broker in addition to taking advantages of WS-Security and WS-Trust standards. The interaction of these components maintains session auditing and dynamic trust among services. This solution is transparent to the services, which allows auditing of legacy services without modification.

Drawn from our industrial collaborations (Ocean Observatories Initative, http://​www.​oceanobservatori​es.​org/​ , JBoss Savara Project, http://​www.​jboss.​org/​savara ) on Scribble, a choreography description language based on multiparty session types, and its theoretical foundations (Honda et al., in POPL, pp 273–284, 2008 ), this article proposes a dynamic verification framework for structured interruptible conversation programming. We first present our extension of Scribble to support the specification of asynchronously interruptible conversations. We then implement a concise API for conversation programming with interrupts in Python that enables session types properties to be dynamically verified for distributed processes. Finally, we expose the underlying theory of our interrupt mechanism, studying its syntax and semantics, its integration in MPST theory and proving the correctness of our design. Our framework ensures the global safety of a system in the presence of asynchronous interrupts through independent runtime monitoring of each endpoint, checking the conformance of the local execution trace to the specified protocol. The usability of our framework for describing and verifying choreographic communications has been tested by integration into the large scientific cyberinfrastructure developed by the Ocean Observatories Initiative. Asynchronous interrupts have proven expressive enough to represent and verify their main classes of communication patterns, including asynchronous streaming and various timeout-based protocols, without introducing any implicit synchronisations. Benchmarks show conversation programming and monitoring can be realised with little overhead.','Formal Methods in System Design',2,'Romain DemangeonKohei HondaRaymond HuRumyana NeykovaNobuko Yoshida','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(2072,'Multi levels semantic architecture for multimodal interaction','2013','3',' Knowledge representation language Description logic Ontologies Multi-agent systems Semantic memory Multimodal interaction','Abstract This paper presents a semantic architecture for solving multimodal interaction.

Modeling such environments is important, but cannot be done without effective conceptual models. A problem in information-rich environments is a disconnect between the control-flow across tasks and the information flow that must accompany these tasks. This can pose a challenge for supporting workflows in such environments. Micro-level concerns such as information seeking, sharing, recording, interpreting and hand-offs are not captured in existing workflow models. Without these information-related tasks, the control flows depicted appear to occur magically. We propose an integrated conceptual modeling technique that allows modeling both, control-flows and information-flows. The technique overloads some constructs while retaining their semantic origins, obviating the need to learn new constructs. We elaborate on the model with authentic examples drawn from ethnographic studies of healthcare practices in intensive care units.

However, this generally involves conducting individual simulations of specific sub-processes using default settings as the boundary parameters. This method does not take into account production history influences on the individual sub-processes. In order to improve planning quality using simulations, the individual simulations need to be linked to form a continuous simulation chain. The methodology for linking simulations described in this paper allows flexible extension of the overall system, allowing incorporation of a variety of heterogeneous simulation chains. In addition to linking distributed simulation resources on an infrastructural level, Internetbased access is also provided, which allows partners to collaborate in setting up simulation chains. There is a data integration component to ensure the correct syntactic, structural and semantic transformation of data between the individual heterogeneous simulations and to ensure all the required simulation data is integrated into a common database. To enable integrative analysis of the simulation data for a whole process, there is an interactive visualisation component which can be used on a variety of visualisation systems, from regular workstation computers through to dedicated virtual reality systems with numerous projection surfaces. Interactive modification of dataset timing within the context of analysis is a key aspect in this respect. In future, the system will be expanded so that interactive analyses can be conducted on the in-tegrated database and bidirectionally coupled with the visualisation component in real time. This will enable intuitive access to the integrated simulation data, even across process boundaries, thus providing optimal support for planning or modification of production processes.','',1,'Thomas BeerTobias MeisenRudolf ReinhardDaniel SchilbergTorsten KuhlenSabina JeschkeChristian Bischof','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(2088,'Intelligent state-based XML firewall','2012','','firewall; rule-based learning systems; service-oriented architecture (SOA); XML','Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style of software systems, in which a system is composed of isolated or independent services.

A number of novel and not so well identified issues occur that make this topic deviating from QoS for networks in a substantial way. Firstly, since Web services aim at hiding details for the external world, no information regarding the infrastructure or resources supporting a Web service are exposed. This prevents from using classical resource based performance models; so contracts are preferred instead. A second important feature is that, unlike in networks, the control in orchestrations may depend on the carried data. Consequently performance and data interfere.

The role of FA in investment decisions is well recognized. While comparing two stocks on FA of their companies it is important to have both drawn from the same sector of economy. This reason motivated us to propose a sectoral portfolio optimization (SPO) which, instead of looking to optimize among all stocks together, focuses on optimizing stocks within each sector on the basis of FA. These stocks are then pooled together and an optimal portfolio is formed from them with their FA weights and mean returns. In context of FA, the four financial ratios included in present study are return on asset (profitable ratio), debt-assets ratio (solvency ratio), current ratio (liquidity ratio), and price-to-earning ratio (valuation ratio). The risk in a portfolio is quantified using the second order stochastic dominance and to this effect constraints are added in the selection process to generate optimal portfolios for rational risk averse investors. The performance of the optimal portfolios from the proposed model is tested against the portfolios from the traditional second order stochastic dominance model [named (SSDP) in this work], the benchmark index and four 5-star rated mutual funds of India from diversified equity. The out-of-sample analysis is carried on mean returns, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and also their ability to dominate the benchmark index in almost second order stochastic dominance sense over the tolerable violation regions. The stock price data for the period April 2004 to November 2014 of S&P BSE 500 index is used for testing the models. The optimal portfolios generated from the SPO perform better than the portfolios generated from the (SSDP), the benchmark index and the MFs, indicating effectiveness of FA in SPO framework.','Annals of Operations Research',1,'Amita SharmaAparna Mehra','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(2109,'Data encryption framework model with watermark security for Data Storage in public cloud model','2014','1','Cloud Data Storage;Cloud Encryption;Data Confidency;Data Privacy;Encryption Model;Watermark Security','Cloud computing technology is a new concept of providing dramatically scalable and virtualized resources.

We propose an algorithm that avoids the full computation of the product of services, and instead constructs the orchestrator incrementally. Unlike most algorithms where the whole state space, which is exponential in the number of services, is visited, the proposed algorithm can find a solution by visiting only the pertinent portion of the state space.

Security becomes even a much bigger concern when services built on top of many commercial clouds have to interoperate. Among others, the value of the service delivered to end customers is strongly affected by the security of network which providers are able to build in typical SOA contexts. Currently, every provider advertises its own security strategy by means of proprietary policies, which are sometimes ambiguous and very often address the security problem from a non-uniform perspective. Even policies expressed in standardized languages do not appear to fit a dynamic scenario like the SOA\'s, where services need to be sought and composed on the fly in a way that is compatible with the end-to-end security requirements. We then propose an approach that leverages on the semantic technology to enrich standardized security policies with an ad-hoc content. The semantic annotation of policies enables machine reasoning which is then used for both the discovery and the composition of security-enabled services. In the presented approach the semantic enrichment of policies is enforced by an automatic procedure.

Combined, our results confer strong correctness guarantees for communicating systems. In particular, parametricity is key to derive non-trivial results about internal protocol independence, a concurrent analogous of representation independence, and non-interference properties of modular, distributed systems.','',1,'Luís CairesJorge A.

The current state of such training systems must advance to a Training as a Service (TaaS) future state in order to adapt to a volatile defense budget, conform to policy updates, and enhance the training capabilities afforded to the War fighter. TaaS will transform current Army training applications into distributed web-based services, allowing them to be accessible across any location via thin client workstations and wireless mobile devices. The motivation behind this migration is coming from the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture Guidance published by the U.S. Army Chief Information Officer and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. In order to achieve the COE objectives, the Army recently launched a pilot study on the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA). CTIA is the foundation architecture of the Army\'s Live Training Transformation (LT2) Product Line that provides software infrastructure and services to live training product applications. This paper describes the migration of CTIA to TaaS using a specific set of modern computing technologies that will enable rapid delivery of training capabilities across servers, mobile devices, and heterogeneous platforms. Specifically service-oriented architecture (SOA) and cloud computing are considered which can satisfy the requirements of the TaaS and COE, and meet user demands for an enhanced training experience. Furthermore, this paper discusses the approach taken to elicit the future needs of the Army\'s live training community, and how cloud computing and SOA are leveraged to meet required capabilities. Lastly, this paper discusses some unique considerations on SOA-related security issues.','Cloud Engineering (IC2E), 2013 IEEE International Conference on',1,'J. T. Lanman; P. K.

Such dynamism leads to new challenges in security and dependability. Collaborating services in a system with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) may belong to different security realms but often need to be engaged dynamically at runtime. If their security realms do not have a direct cross-realm authentication relationship, it is technically difficult to enable any secure collaboration between the services. A potential solution to this would be to locate intermediate realms at runtime, which serve as an authentication path between the two separate realms. However, the process of generating an authentication path for two distributed services can be highly complicated. It could involve a large number of extra operations for credential conversion and require a long chain of invocations to intermediate services. In this paper, we address this problem by designing and implementing a new cross-realm authentication protocol for dynamic service interactions, based on the notion of service-oriented multiparty business sessions. Our protocol requires neither credential conversion nor establishment of any authentication path between the participating services in a business session. The correctness of the protocol is formally analyzed and proven, and an empirical study is performed using two production-quality Grid systems, Globus 4 and CROWN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol and its implementation have a sound level of scalability and impose only a limited degree of performance overhead, which is for example comparable with those security-related overheads in Globus 4. © 2008 IEEE.','',1,'Xu J., Zhang D., Liu L., Li X.','scopus/service oriented architecture security.csv','scopus','\0'),(2149,'Towards a Taxonomy Framework of Evolution for SOA Solution: From a Practical Point of View','2013','3',' Taxonomy Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Change Management','Abstract Presently, the research on evolution of SOA solution is becoming more and more important in industry.

Using this model for B2B exchanges would work as an incentive to open up SMB enterprises for B2B business and will go a long way in reducing costs for SMB enterprises. © 2012 IEEE.','',1,'Visweswara U.M., Gohad A., Rao P.S.','scopus/soa security.csv','scopus','\0'),(2166,'Towards Achieving Data Security with the Cloud Computing Adoption Framework','2016','6','Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN); Cloud Computing Adoption Framework (CCAF); Data security in the Data Center; multi-layered security protection; security framework','Offering real-time data security for petabytes of data is important for cloud computing. A recent survey on cloud security states that the security of users\' data has the highest priority as well as concern. We believe this can only be able to achieve with an approach that is systematic, adoptable and well-structured. Therefore, this paper has developed a framework known as Cloud Computing Adoption Framework (CCAF) which has been customized for securing cloud data. This paper explains the overview, rationale and components in the CCAF to protect data security. CCAF is illustrated by the system design based on the requirements and the implementation demonstrated by the CCAF multi-layered security. Since our Data Center has 10 petabytes of data, there is a huge task to provide real-time protection and quarantine. We use Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) to simulate how data is in use. The use of BPMN simulation allows us to evaluate the chosen security performances before actual implementation. Results show that the time to take control of security breach can take between 50 and 125 hours. This means that additional security is required to ensure all data is well-protected in the crucial 125 hours. This paper has also demonstrated that CCAF multi-layered security can protect data in real-time and it has three layers of security: 1) firewall and access control; 2) identity management and intrusion prevention and 3) convergent encryption. To validate CCAF, this paper has undertaken two sets of ethical-hacking experiments involved with penetration testing with 10,000 trojans and viruses. The CCAF multi-layered security can block 9,919 viruses and trojans which can be destroyed in seconds and the remaining ones can be quarantined or isolated. The experiments show although the percentage of blocking can decrease for continuous injection of viruses and trojans, 97.43 percent of them can be quarantined. Our CCAF multi-layered security has an average of 20 percent better performance than the single-layered approach which could only block 7,438 viruses and trojans. CCAF can be more effective when combined with BPMN simulation to evaluate security process and penetrating testing results. © 2016 IEEE.','',2,'Chang V., Ramachandran M.','scopus/bpmn security.csv','scopus',''),(2167,'FDI and the Industrial Internet of Things','2015','','field device integration;industrie 4.0;installed base migration;internet of things;security;semantics','The Field Device Integration (FDI) standard represents an industry-wide consensus on device integration for the process industry.

Although the open source community has grown immensely during the last decade, there is still no clear answer. Service-oriented software and middleware tends to rely on highly complex and interrelated standards and frameworks. Thus, it is questionable if small and loosely coupled teams, as typical in open source software development, can compete with major vendors. Here, we focus on a central part of service-oriented software systems, i.e., process engines for service orchestration, and compare open source and proprietary solutions. We use the Web Services Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) and compare standard conformance and its impact on language expressiveness in terms of workflow pattern support of eight engines. The results show that, although the top open source engines are on par with their proprietary counterparts, in general proprietary engines perform better.','',2,'Simon HarrerJörg LenhardGuido Wirtz','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(2169,'Securing Web Applications, Services, and Servers','2013','','Authentication; Hacktivists; Internet compliance; Privacy; Servers; Services; Transport layer security; WS-Security; WWeb applications','The advance of Web applications, services, and server technologies promises to have far-reaching effects on the Internet and enterprise networks.

This study proposes a scientific-knowledge processing framework, which offers high performance by using grid computing technology for extracting important entities and their relations from the scientific literature. Since the grid computing provides a large volume of data storage and high-speed computing, the proposed framework can efficiently analyze the massive body of scientific literature and process knowledge. The workflow tool that we have developed for the proposed framework enables users to easily design and execute complicated applications that consist of complicated scientific-knowledge processes. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework reduced working time by approximately 83 % when the number of running nodes was assigned in accordance with the workload ratio of each step in scientific-knowledge processes.

On the other hand certain constraints regarding the required performances (i.e. the required QoS levels) may also be given. Therefore, web service selection presents a multiple-objective multiple constraint problem and in this paper we model it as a discrete multiple-objective linear fractional programming (MOLFP) problem.

This results in identifying a unified requirements set, i.e. 186 requirements, and stakeholders set, i.e. 19 stakeholders, for eGov PSP systems. Based on these findings, we determine 16 overview use cases demonstrating the basic functionality of such systems. Our findings are modeled using ArchiMate 2.0 notation. The identified requirements set can be used by virtually any public organization providing public services for developing its own EA. As a result, it can lead to the reduction of eGov PSP project failures, the decrease of software development costs and the improvement of its effectiveness and quality.

Drawn from our industrial collaborations [33,28] on Scribble, a choreography description language based on multiparty session types, this paper proposes a dynamic verification framework for structured interruptible conversation programming. We first present our extension of Scribble to support the specification of asynchronously interruptible conversations. We then implement a concise API for conversation programming with interrupts in Python that enables session types properties to be dynamically verified for distributed processes. Our framework ensures the global safety of a system in the presence of asynchronous interrupts through independent runtime monitoring of each endpoint, checking the conformance of the local execution trace to the specified protocol. The usability of our framework for describing and verifying choreographic communications has been tested by integration into the large scientific cyberinfrastructure developed by the Ocean Observatories Initiative. Asynchronous interrupts have proven expressive enough to represent and verify their main classes of communication patterns, including asynchronous streaming and various timeout-based protocols, without requiring additional synchronisation mechanisms. Benchmarks show conversation programming and monitoring can be realised with little overhead.','',2,'Raymond HuRumyana NeykovaNobuko YoshidaRomain DemangeonKohei Honda','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(2199,'Comparative Study of Service-Based Security-Aware Business Processes Automation Tools','2013','0','automation;business processes;service composition;web services','The use of business processes to model and design business activities is becoming a reality to a significant number of companies.

Information quality is frequently identified as one of the main limitations of social media in healthcare. The objective of the paper is to discuss the social implications and limitations on information quality in healthcare social media, and particularly to contribute to the analysis and development of healthcare social networks (SN) and online healthcare social network services (SNS). For that reason, a formal architectural analysis of healthcare SN and SNS has been proposed, considering the complexity of both systems, but stressing on quality of Information aspects. Any social system - and its network of interrelations - can be analyzed as a real world system. Therefore, it is possible to model the structural components, interrelations and functionality (system architecture) of healthcare SN and SNS. The Generic Component Model (GCM) has demonstrated to be an ideal architectural framework for any real system’s analysis. Based on the GCM, the architecture of quality aware healthcare SNS is proposed. Information quality is addressed in the domain dimension of the GCM, supported by the definition of information quality policies. The practical implementation of quality-driven online SNS and information quality policies was demonstrated by the development of an online SNS supporting health promotion programs in a healthcare institution. In order to evaluate the relevance of the information quality policies proposed, a descriptive study was performed, in which the content published in the online SNS was selected strictly following the information quality policy. The study demonstrated that users’ perceived information quality was high. The paper addresses sociotechnical aspects of social media by providing a formal method for the management of information quality in online healthcare social networks.','Health and Technology',1,'D.

Such dynamism leads to new challenges in security and dependability. Collaborating services in a system with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) may belong to different security realms but often need to be engaged dynamically at runtime. If their security realms do not have a direct cross-realm authentication relationship, it is technically difficult to enable any secure collaboration between the services. A potential solution to this would be to locate intermediate realms at runtime, which serve as an authentication path between the two separate realms. However, the process of generating an authentication path for two distributed services can be highly complicated. It could involve a large number of extra operations for credential conversion and require a long chain of invocations to intermediate services. In this paper, we address this problem by designing and implementing a new cross-realm authentication protocol for dynamic service interactions, based on the notion of service-oriented multiparty business sessions. Our protocol requires neither credential conversion nor establishment of any authentication path between the participating services in a business session. The correctness of the protocol is formally analyzed and proven, and an empirical study is performed using two production-quality Grid systems, Globus 4 and CROWN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol and its implementation have a sound level of scalability and impose only a limited degree of performance overhead, which is for example comparable with those security-related overheads in Globus 4.','IEEE Transactions on Services Computing',1,'J.

Business services have distinctive features that are not typically observed in Web services, e.g. significant portions of the functionality of business services might be executed in a human-mediated fashion. The representation of business services requires that we view human activity and human-mediated functionality through the lens of computing and systems engineering. Given the specification of a relatively complex business service, practitioners can deal with its complexity either by breaking it down into constituent services through common practices such as outsourcing or delegation, or by picking up an existing group of services (e.g. from a service catalog) that best realize that functionality. To address these challenges, we devise a formal machinery to (a) verify if a group of services contractually match the specification of the larger service in question; (b) to assess the contractual proximity of service groups relative to a contractual service specification to help decide which combination of services from a catalog best realize the desired functionality.','',1,'Lam-Son Lê','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(2206,'Model-based specification and refinement of usage control policies','2013','4','','In existing usage control policy frameworks, policies consisting of authorizations and obligations are specified at a low level of abstraction.

Analysis of the results show that by employing EECOF the size of data transmission over the wireless network medium is reduced by 84 % and energy consumption cost is reduced by 69.9 % in offloading different components of the prototype application.

[ Objectives ] This research aims at identifying the architectural problems and before-release solutions of interoperability on its different levels in information systems, and exploring the interoperability metrics and research methods used to evaluate identified solutions. [ Methods ] We performed a scoping study in five digital libraries and descriptively analyzed the results of the selected studies. [ Results ] From the 22 studies included, we extracted a number of architectural interoperability problems on the technical, syntactical, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Many problems are caused by systems’ heterogeneity on data representation, meaning or context. The identified solutions include standards, ontologies, wrappers, or mediators. Evaluation methods to validate solutions mostly included toy examples rather than empirical studies. [ Conclusions ] Progress has been made in the software architecture research area to solve interoperability problems. Nevertheless, more researches need to be spent on solutions for the higher levels of interoperability accompanied with proper empirical evaluation for their effectiveness and usefulness.','',1,'Hadil AbukwaikDavide TaibiDieter Rombach','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(2231,'A cloud Computation Architecture for Unconventional Emergency Management','2013','0',' Unconventional emergency Cloud computing Emergency management','Abstract With the development of technologies and the deterioration of natural environment, unconventional emergencies outbreak more unexpectedly and diffuse more quickly and broadly.

Emergency management decisions are facing great challenges, and have attracted great concerns from government departments, academia and industries. In recent years, as a service-oriented computing mode, the cloud computing technology brings advantage in information sharing, resource allocating, and distributed high-performance computing, which makes it a feasible solution to unconventional emergency management, research, quick response and decision support. In this paper, we propose a cloud computation architecture for unconventional emergency management, which involves the key technologies including computation resource pooling, scalable extension of computation resource and services and user-centroid service management. The proposed architecture supports multilevel demand in computation and storage resource by providing services such as virtual machine, big data storage, web information detection and spatio-temporal data visualization.

In the past, the focus on artifact dependencies has been at the design and code level rather than at the requirements level. This is due to the difficulties in identifying dependencies in a text-based requirements specification. We observed that difficulties reside in the disconnection among itemized requirements and the lack of a more systematic approach to write text-based requirements. Business process models are an increasingly important part of a requirements specification. In this paper, we present a mapping between workflow patterns and dependency types to aid dependency identification and change impact analysis. Our real-world case study results show that some participants, with the help of the mapping, discovered more dependencies than other participants using text-based requirements only. Though many of these additional dependencies are highly difficult to spot from the text-based requirements, they are however very useful for change impact analysis.','',2,'Juan LiRoss JefferyKam Hay FungLiming ZhuQing WangHe ZhangXiwei Xu','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer','\0'),(2235,'Cerberus: Automated Synthesis of Enforcement Mechanisms for Security-Sensitive Business Processes','2016','0','','Abstract Cerberus is a tool to automatically synthesize run-time enforcement mechanisms for security-sensitive Business Processes (BPs).

However, most state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from high computational complexity, such as O (| V | 4 | T |), where V is the node set and T is the topic set. We devise a general indexing data structure that provides a significantly faster implementation, with O (| V | 2 | T |) running time, for different state-of-the-art algorithms. The generality of the indexing data structure is due to the fact that it enables edge lookup by both node degree and edge contribution , a central metric in all existing algorithms. When tested on typical pub/sub workloads, the speedup observed was by a factor of over 1 000, thereby rendering the algorithms more suitable for practical use. For example, under a typically Zipf distributed pub/sub workload, with 1 000 nodes and 100 topics, our new implementation completes in 3.823 seconds, while the previous alternative takes over 555 minutes.','',1,'Chen ChenRoman VitenbergHans-Arno Jacobsen','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(2238,'SERVICES 2012: 2012 IEEE Eighth World Congress on Services [Cover art]','2012','0','','The following topics are dealt with: software fault tolerance; service-oriented software; data security; cloud computing; and Web services.','2012 IEEE Eighth World Congress on Services',1,'','ieee/service oriented architecture security.csv','ieee','\0'),(2239,'VxBPEL-ODE: A variability enhanced service composition engine','2014','','Service Compositions; Service Oriented Architecture; Variability Management; VxBPEL','Service compositions have become a powerful development paradigm to create distributed applications out of autonomous Web services.

These capabilities of SWS are useful in distributed environments such as that of e-government.

However, as this entails losing some control over the application and its data, SaaS providers are in practice reluctant to migrate to a PaaS platform entirely. To alleviate such concerns of vendor lock-in, the concept of a multi-cloud involves integrating and combining multiple cloud environments, private as well as public, but also involving multiple providers and different technologies. This has the added benefit that it further improves overall availability, flexibility and scalability. Current support for multi-cloud applications however is limited.

The process of selecting relevant services from a service repository in a heterogeneous environment is a difficult task. Use of different search engines help in selection process by efficiently searching the service repository (like UDDI), peer-to-peer networks, service portals etc. Fixing up appropriate services is necessary because composition of these services leads to the development of a particular application. In this paper, soft computing technique such as ANN and Fuzzy logic are employed for optimal selection of web service with the help of the requisite attributes related to quality of service. A comparative study of performance of both the techniques based on error parameter has been made in order to help in critical assessment.','',1,'Debendra Kumar NaikSmita KumariSantanu Kumar Rath','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(2259,'On the security of international data exchange services for e-governance systems','2015','0','','Abstract The effects of globalisation and information welfare combined with the increasing mobility of individuals lead to a number of challenges to modern states. In order to guarantee a smooth, secure, uninterrupted organisational flow, governments and their subsidiaries need to cooperate and exchange data on individuals and organisations across national borders. However, insufficiently secured communication of such data imposes security threats which may endanger the individual’s privacy. Currently, several states within Europe develop and operate e-governance systems. These are primarily designed to allow the exchange of data within the institutions of one state. However, examples such as the Estonian e-governance backbone system X-Road strive towards an EU-wide expansion. Technical solutions for the transnational exchange of data between governmental institutions are an unavoidable part of the future of cyberspace. Despite the fact that EU specifications exist, the discrepancy between specification and implementation becomes immanent. This article explores some of the general aspects of the design of secure transnational data exchange frameworks. A comparative analysis of existing e-governance systems within Europe is given based on defined security aspects. It is explored how decisions made in the design may affect the security of the underlying network and its components. The challenges of transnational data exchange frameworks are discussed.','Datenschutz und Datensicherheit - DuD',1,'Kim HartmannChristoph Steup','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(2260,'An approach to extract RBAC models from BPEL4WS processes','2004','16','','The Business Process Execution Language for Web services (BPEL) has become the defacto standard for Web service composition.

Several methods have been developed to support compliance checking of conceptual models. However, their focus on distinct modeling languages and mostly linear (i.e., predecessor-successor related) compliance rules may hinder widespread adoption and application in practice. Furthermore, hardly any of them has been evaluated in a real-world setting. We address this issue by applying a generic pattern matching approach for conceptual models to business process compliance checking in the financial sector. It consists of a model query language, a search algorithm and a corresponding modelling tool prototype. It is (1) applicable for all graph-based conceptual modeling languages and (2) for different kinds of compliance rules. Furthermore, based on an applicability check, we (3) evaluate the approach in a financial industry project setting against its relevance for decision support of audit and compliance management tasks.','Information Systems Frontiers',2,'Jörg BeckerPatrick DelfmannHanns-Alexander DietrichMatthias SteinhorstMathias Eggert','springer/bpel security.csv','springer',''),(2262,'Controllability of Time-Aware Processes at Run Time','2013','3',' Process-aware Information System Temporal Perspective Temporal Constraints Process Execution Controllability','Abstract Companies increasingly adopt process-aware information systems (PAISs) to analyze, coordinate, and monitor their business processes. Although the proper handling of temporal constraints (e.g., deadlines, minimum time lags between activities) is crucial for many applications, contemporary PAISs lack a sophisticated support of the temporal perspective of business processes. In previous work, we introduced Conditional Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (CSTNU) for checking controllability of time constraint networks with decision points. In particular, controllability refers to the ability of executing a time constraint network independent of the actual duration of its activities, while satisfying all temporal constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate how CSTNUs can be applied to time-aware business processes in order verify their controllability at design as well as at run time. In particular, we present an algorithm for ensuring the controllability of time-aware process instances during run time. Overall, proper run-time support of time-aware business processes will broaden the use of PAIS significantly.','',2,'Andreas LanzRoberto PosenatoCarlo CombiManfred Reichert','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer','\0'),(2263,'Anomaly Detection System Based on Service Oriented Architecture','2012','0','','Abstract The problem of the network security has been taken up since eighties and has been developed up to present day.

At the same time, the demand on the security, privacy, and compliance of such systems is increasing as well. As a result, the costs - with respect to computational effort at runtime as well as financial costs - for operating business-process driven systems increase steadily. In this paper, we present a method for statically checking the security and conformance of the system implementation, e.g., on the source code level, to requirements specified on the business process level. As the compliance is statically guaranteed - already at design-time - this method reduces the number of run-time checks for ensuring the security and compliance and, thus, improves the runtime performances.

In the recent years several solutions have been proposed to implement digital infrastructures for sharing and processing scientific data and observations. Spatial data infrastructures currently enable effective and efficient geo-information data sharing in many disciplinary communities, and innovative solutions are under development to support new open data and linked data paradigms. In parallel, High Performance Computing systems, computing grids and more recently cloud services, enable fast processing of big data. However, the integration of data and computing e-infrastructures is a raising issue in multidisciplinary research. In the context of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) initiative, an innovative approach has been proposed. Taking into account that the heterogeneity of data and computing e-infrastructures and related technologies cannot be reduced beyond a certain extent, since it is due to the need of supporting use cases and scenarios from different scientific communities, a brokering solution has been designed and developed. A Business Process Broker (BPB) is a component which takes a formal description of a scientific business process, and translates it in an executable process which can be run on multiple and remote processing and workflow services. In doing this it solves all the interoperability issues in a (semi-)automated way. It allows lowering the entry barrier for both computing service providers and users, decoupling the specification of the scientific process from the underlying enabling infrastructures. The paper presents and discusses a BPB use-case from the European project IASON, implementing an Earth Observation application involving satellite image mosaicking, HPC computing services and spatial data e-infrastructures.','Earth Science Informatics',1,'Paolo MazzettiRoberto RoncellaDanut MihonVictor BacuPierre LacroixYaniss GuigozNicolas RayGregory GiulianiDorian GorganStefano Nativi','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(2273,'DroidMiner: Automated Mining and Characterization of Fine-grained Malicious Behaviors in Android Applications','2014','5',' Mobile Security Android Malware Analysis and Detection','Abstract Most existing malicious Android app detection approaches rely on manually selected detection heuristics, features, and models.

We formalize a two-level behavioral graph representation used to capture Android app program logic, and design new techniques to identify and label elements of the graph that capture malicious behavioral patterns (or malicious modalities). After the automatic learning of these malicious behavioral models, DroidMiner can scan a new Android app to ( i ) determine whether it contains malicious modalities, ( ii ) diagnose the malware family to which it is most closely associated, ( iii ) and provide further evidence as to why the app is considered to be malicious by including a concise description of identified malicious behaviors. We evaluate DroidMiner using 2,466 malicious apps, identified from a corpus of over 67,000 third-party market Android apps, plus an additional set of over 10,000 official market Android apps. Using this set of real-world apps, we demonstrate that DroidMiner achieves a 95.3% detection rate, with only a 0.4% false positive rate.

It can be explained from two aspects: (1) The data center is typically a sharing environment for all the users, users may submit different types of jobs (HPC and Cloud computing) for processing currently; (2) Some applications can be divided into two parts of subtasks which are suitable to HPC and Cloud computing respectively, e.g. the AMS (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer) experiment is such a typical application. Thus in order to provide good service for both computing models, it is needed to construct a HPC and Cloud hybrid environment. An existing management mechanism is to allocate fixed proportions of resources for different application environments. However, this approach has a significant performance drawback that is the low resource utilization. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose a dynamic resource management framework and mechanism to satisfy the requirements of both HPC and Cloud computing. Firstly we present a prediction model that is used to predict the arrival rate of all kinds of jobs (HPC types and Cloud types). Based on the prediction results, we propose a dynamic resource allocation algorithm, which manages dynamic resources allocation by using queuing theory. Finally, we evaluate our mechanism by real data sets from AMS experiment and Cloud tasks running on the HPC center in Southeast University. The results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively improve resource utilization at least 30% in this hybrid environment.','',2,'Miao ChenFang DongJunzhou Luo','springer/bpel security.csv','springer','\0'),(2275,'Multicenter Data Sharing for Collaboration in Sleep Medicine','2015','0','Cloud;OpenStack;REST;XNAT;biosignal;polysomnography;sleep','Clinical Sleep Research is an inherent multidisciplinary field, as many health issues may affect a person\'s sleep conditions and sleep disorders may cause several health problems.

Process mining is not limited to process discovery and also includes conformance checking. Conformance checking techniques are used for evaluating the quality of discovered process models and to diagnose deviations from some normative model (e.g., to check compliance). Existing conformance checking approaches typically focus on the control-flow, thus being unable to diagnose deviations concerning data. This paper proposes a technique to check the conformance of data-aware process models. We use so-called Petri nets with Data to model data variables, guards, and read/write actions. Data-aware conformance checking problem may be very time consuming and sometimes even intractable when there are many transitions and data variables. Therefore, we propose a technique to decompose large data-aware conformance checking problems into smaller problems that can be solved more efficiently. We provide a general correctness result showing that decomposition does not influence the outcome of conformance checking. The approach is supported through ProM plug-ins and experimental results show significant performance improvements. Experiments have also been conducted with a real-life case study, thus showing that the approach is also relevant in real business settings.','',2,'Massimiliano de LeoniJorge Munoz-GamaJosep CarmonaWil M.

Specifically, we developed two PSO variants, one with weighted-sum fitness function (WSPSO) and the other with dominance-based fitness function. Concretely, it uses the fast Non-dominate Sorting scheme, and thus is called NSPSO. The experimental results showed that both PSO variants performed better than NSGA-II, which is the one of the most commonly used multi-objective genetic algorithms. Furthermore, we have found that NSPSO achieved a more diverse set of solutions than WSPSO, and thus covers the Pareto front better.

Facing high degrees of variability, these systems often employ variability models to explicitly capture user-configurable features (e.g., systems options) and the constraints they impose. The explicit representation of features allows them to be referenced in different variation points across different artifacts, enabling the latter to vary according to specific feature selections. In such settings, the evolution of variability models interplays with the evolution of related artifacts, requiring the two to evolve together, or coevolve. Interestingly, little is known about how such coevolution occurs in real-world systems, as existing research has focused mostly on variability evolution as it happens in variability models only. Furthermore, existing techniques supporting variability evolution are usually validated with randomly-generated variability models or evolution scenarios that do not stem from practice. As the community lacks a deep understanding of how variability evolution occurs in real-world systems and how it relates to the evolution of different kinds of software artifacts, it is not surprising that industry reports existing tools and solutions ineffective, as they do not handle the complexity found in practice. Attempting to mitigate this overall lack of knowledge and to support tool builders with insights on how variability models coevolve with other artifact types, we study a large and complex real-world variant-rich software system: the Linux kernel. Specifically, we extract variability-coevolution patterns capturing changes in the variability model of the Linux kernel with subsequent changes in Makefiles and C source code. From the analysis of the patterns, we report on findings concerning evolution principles found in the kernel, and we reveal deficiencies in existing tools and theory when handling changes captured by our patterns.','Empirical Software Engineering',1,'Leonardo PassosLeopoldo TeixeiraNicolas DintznerSven ApelAndrzej WąsowskiKrzysztof CzarneckiPaulo BorbaJianmei Guo','springer/soa security.csv','springer',''),(2287,'Autonomic Intelligent Cyber-Sensor to Support Industrial Control Network Awareness','2014','4','Autonomic computing;control systems;industrial ecosystems;network security;service-oriented architecture','The proliferation of digital devices in a networked industrial ecosystem, along with an exponential growth in complexity and scope, has resulted in elevated security concerns and management complexity issues. This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations. In addition, the anomaly detection algorithm achieved a 99.9% recognition rate. All output from the modules were correctly distributed using the common communication structure.','IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics',1,'T. Vollmer; M. Manic; O.

The sensor systems are usually attached on the body, on objects, or in the environment, directly surrounding persons or groups whose activities or contextual information has to be detected. For sensors that are exploited in this kind of systems, it is essential that their modalities, positions and technical details are initially defined to ensure a stable and accurate system execution. In contrast to that, opportunistic sensing allows for selecting and utilizing sensors, as they happen to be accessible according to their spontaneous availability, without presumably defining the input modalities, on a goal-oriented principle. One major benefit thereby is the capability of utilizing sensors of different kinds and modalities, even immaterial sources of information like webservices, by abstracting low-level access details. This emerges the need to roll out the data federating entity as decentralized collecting point. Cloud-based technologies enable space- and time-free utilization of a vast amount of heterogeneous sensor devices reaching from simple physical devices (e.g., GPS, accelerometers, as they are conventionally included on today’s smart phones) to social media sensors, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.

Yet, choosing a specific service composition may fail to deliver the expected robustness, but reverting early choices may jeopardise the success of any Cloud project. Inspired by existing models used in Biology to quantify the robustness of ecosystems, we show how to tailor them to obtain early indicators of robustness for cloud-based deployments. This technique helps identify weakest parts in the overall architecture and in turn mitigates the risk of having to revert key architectural choices. We illustrate our approach by comparing the robustness of four alternative deployments of the SensApp application, which includes a MongoDB database, four REST services and a graphical web-front end.','Journal of Cloud Computing',1,'Franck ChauvelHui SongNicolas FerryFranck Fleurey','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer',''),(2290,'Wireless Sensor Networks in Next Generation Communication Infrastructure: Vision and Challenges','2014','0',' Wireless sensor network cyber physical system cloud computing next generation network seamless integration','Abstract Last decade saw the development of Wireless Sensor Networks with multitude of applications built around the sensors.

This paper presents evidence that a canonical set of reuse interfaces has emerged over time: the variation, customization, and usage interfaces (VCU). A reusable artifact that provides all three interfaces reaches the highest potential of reuse, as it explicitly exposes how the artifact can be manipulated during the reuse process along these three dimensions. We demonstrate the wide applicability of the VCU interfaces along two axes: across abstraction layers of a system specification and across existing reuse techniques. The former is shown with the help of a comprehensive case study including reusable requirements, software, and hardware models for the authorization domain. The latter is shown with a discussion on how the VCU interfaces relate to existing reuse techniques.','',2,'Jörg KienzleGunter MussbacherOmar AlamMatthias SchöttleNicolas BelloirPhilippe ColletBenoit CombemaleJulien DeAntoniJacques KleinBernhard Rumpe','springer/bpmn security.csv','springer',''),(2293,'Towards Compliance Verification Between Global and Local Process Models','2015','0','','Abstract This paper addresses the question how to verify that the local workflow of an organisation participating in a cross-organisational collaboration is in compliance with the globally specified rules of that collaboration.

For this reason, to effectively deal with the obstacles due to continuous context changes, an incremental refinement of provided services is needed. We propose a new model that allows service functionalities to be defined partially, through the use of abstract activities. The refinement of these activities is postponed and performed incrementally at runtime, using the actual context as a guide. Our approach lets a service provider avoid the hard-coding of all service functionalities and their possible compositions at design time, delaying their refinement until the execution phase.

Still, static techniques either have high precision, in which case powerful judgements are hard to achieve automatically, or they use abstractions supporting increased automation, but possibly losing important aspects of the concrete system in the process. Runtime verification has complementary strengths and weaknesses. It combines full precision of the model (including the real deployment environment) with full automation, but cannot judge future and alternative runs. Another drawback of runtime verification can be the computational overhead of monitoring the running system which, although typically not very high, can still be prohibitive in certain settings. In this paper we propose a framework to combine static analysis techniques and runtime verification with the aim of getting the best of both techniques. In particular, we discuss an instantiation of our framework for the deductive theorem prover KeY, and the runtime verification tool Larva . Apart from combining static and dynamic verification, this approach also combines the data centric analysis of KeY with the control centric analysis of Larva . An advantage of the approach is that, through the use of a single specification which can be used by both analysis techniques, expensive parts of the analysis could be moved to the static phase, allowing the runtime monitor to make significant assumptions, dropping parts of expensive checks at runtime.

In this paper, we propose a spectro-temporal directional derivative (STDD) feature that requires less number of computations in the modeling and yet gives high recognition accuracy in the ASR system. The proposed STDD feature is achieved by applying different directional derivative filters in the spectro-temporal domain. The feature dimension is then compressed by discrete cosine transform. The experiments are performed with voice samples of Arabic numerals spoken by persons with and without voice pathology. The experimental results show that the STDD feature outperforms the conventional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients both in clean and noisy environments.','Multimedia Tools and Applications',1,'Ghulam MuhammadMehedi MasudAbdulhameed AlelaiwiMd.

Adequate means for analyzing the security risks of such infrastructures is a prerequisite for properly understanding the security needs and for maintaining appropriate incident preparedness. Risk management is coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk, and includes the identification, analysis and mitigation of unacceptable risks. For critical infrastructures consisting of interdependent systems, risk analysis and mitigation is challenging because the overall risk picture may be strongly affected by changes in only a few of the systems. In order to continuously manage risks and maintain an adequate level of protection, there is a need to continuously maintain the validity of risk models while systems change and evolve. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an approach to model-driven security risk analysis of changing and evolving systems. The approach is a tool-supported method with techniques and modeling support for traceability of system changes to risk models, as well as the explicit modeling of the impact of changes on the current risk picture. The presented artifacts are exemplified and validated in the domain of air traffic management.','Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing',1,'Bjørnar SolhaugFredrik Seehusen','springer/soa security.csv','springer','\0'),(2320,'search GenBank: interactive orchestration and ad-hoc choreography of Web services in the exploration of the biomedical resources of the National Center For Biotechnology Information','2013','1',' NCBI entrez Entrez databases Entrez search engine Entrez programming utilities Data exploration Data searching Data querying Web services Orchestration Choreography','Abstract Background Due to the growing number of biomedical entries in data repositories of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), it is difficult to collect, manage and process all of these entries in one place by third-party software developers without significant investment in hardware and software infrastructure, its maintenance and administration. Web services allow development of software applications that integrate in one place the functionality and processing logic of distributed software components, without integrating the components themselves and without integrating the resources to which they have access. This is achieved by appropriate orchestration or choreography of available Web services and their shared functions. After the successful application of Web services in the business sector, this technology can now be used to build composite software tools that are oriented towards biomedical data processing. Results We have developed a new tool for efficient and dynamic data exploration in GenBank and other NCBI databases. A dedicated search GenBank system makes use of NCBI Web services and a package of Entrez Programming Utilities (eUtils) in order to provide extended searching capabilities in NCBI data repositories. In search GenBank users can use one of the three exploration paths: simple data searching based on the specified user’s query, advanced data searching based on the specified user’s query, and advanced data exploration with the use of macros. search GenBank orchestrates calls of particular tools available through the NCBI Web service providing requested functionality, while users interactively browse selected records in search GenBank and traverse between NCBI databases using available links. On the other hand, by building macros in the advanced data exploration mode, users create choreographies of eUtils calls, which can lead to the automatic discovery of related data in the specified databases. Conclusions search GenBank extends standard capabilities of the NCBI Entrez search engine in querying biomedical databases. The possibility of creating and saving macros in the search GenBank is a unique feature and has a great potential. The potential will further grow in the future with the increasing density of networks of relationships between data stored in particular databases. search GenBank is available for public use at http://​sgb.​biotools.​pl/​ .','BMC Bioinformatics',1,'Dariusz MrozekBożena Małysiak-MrozekArtur Siążnik','springer/service oriented architecture security.csv','springer','\0'),(2321,'Design and implementation of multilevel security subsystem based on XACML and WEB services','2015','','C4I Systems; Common Operating Picture; Information sharing; Multi Level Security; SOA; WEB Services; XACML','Controlled sharing of confidential information in military environment, especially as a part of joint and coalition forces, is an important mean to achieve the network-centricity goals.

Additionally, this study is to enable developers in beginner or intermediate level to develop an application with the ‘zero coding methodology’ reflected tool developed by this study and not using the conventional program coding methods, eventually providing the environment that anyone, who can use MS office programs, can easily develop an application. The explosively increasing demand for the development of mobile apps is due to all works on typical PCs that should be converted to the smart basis. Although functions to be implemented are the same, different apps should be developed for each platform to result in cost, period and task forces increased a few times. The web-based application platform emerging as a solution for cross platforms is not capable of embodying the desired One Source Multi Use due to speed, UI, and technical incompleteness. Therefore if a “native-based OSMU development platform” is implemented which can develop native apps operating in various mobile operating systems, their high development productivity will contribute to remarkably reduced task forces, costs and time for development and maintenance. Also it will be possible to preoccupy the market of a potential as great as the exiting operating systems, for example, Android, iOS, Windows 8, etc. In order to develop and makes fullest use of smart app authoring tool different approaches should be appropriately employed. Firstly, it is required to have a close relation with legacy systems. Secondly, developers are fully qualified to use office programs. Thirdly, different programs should be also differently developed for business uses.

The high development productivity of one source multi use cross-platform based on Zero Coding will contribute to remarkably reduced task forces, costs and time for development and maintenance.

Our model allows us to specify communication-centric systems whose session behavior can be dynamically updated at run-time. We improve on previous work by proposing an event-based approach: adaptation requests, issued by the system itself or by its context, are assimilated to events which may trigger adaptation routines. These routines exploit type-directed checks to enable the reconfiguration of processes with active protocols. We equip our model with a type system that ensures communication safety and consistency properties: while safety guarantees absence of run-time communication errors, consistency ensures that update actions do not disrupt already established session protocols.

To deploy and enforce such security policies in an enterprise environment, a model-driven transformation between security annotated process models and a security specification language is used. We argue that specific types of organisational control and compliance policies may be expressed in a graphical fashion at the business process modeling level. These can then be transformed into corresponding access control and security policies for business process-driven information systems based on serviceoriented architectures. This approach acts as an enabler for better collaboration between security and business process domain experts to define consistent and valid security policies that can be easily communicated.

Instead, in applications, several workflow instances execute concurrently, may synchronize, and be required to ensure inter-instance constraints. Performing an analysis by considering a finite but arbitrary number of workflow instances can give designers a higher confidence about the quality of their business process. In this paper, we propose an automated technique for the analysis of both intra- and inter-instance authorization constraints in workflow systems.

With the increased adoption of the REST concept, an alternative to SOAP is gaining traction. Security considerations have been part of the SOAP-based standardization work since the very beginning. As a result, a mature and comprehensive set of security-related standards is available for building SOAP-based service systems.

We report on the applicability of our approach via a case study about air traffic management. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.','',2,'Salnitri M., Dalpiaz F., Giorgini P.','scopus/bpmn security.csv','scopus',''),(2344,'Intelligent Data Acquisition and Processing of Remote Monitoring System Based on Internet of Things','2015','0',' SOA architecture Multi thread transmission Cache combined with database','Abstract In this paper, we study how the computational framework underpinned by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm can be utilized in remote monitoring industrial reaction kettle. We analyze a wide variety of reaction kettle monitoring parameters and their characteristics to scope of work. Sensor technologies are used for intelligent data acquisition. Such data are then transferred to a host computer with high frequency signal using ZigBee wireless communication technology. We use multi-thread technology to regular polling access to monitored data. We improve overall system performance by employing a cache module for the most recently used (MRU) data. The development of middleware realizes the communication between the host computer and client application systems. Principles of Service Oriented Architecture are adopted in the design of our system to reduce the coupling of the system components.

However current practices report that security is addressed rather at the later development stages (i.e., design and implementation). This raises a question whether the business processes are performed securely. In this paper, we propose a method to align business process modelling and security engineering. We develop a set of security risk-oriented patterns. Such patterns help to understand security risks that potentially arise within business processes, and to introduce security solutions. To ease the applicability the security risk-oriented patterns are defined using BPMN notations. The proposal is tested in an industrial business model and the findings indicate a positive usefulness to identify important business assets, their security risks and countermeasures.','',2,'Ahmed N., Matulevičius R., Khan N.H.','scopus/bpmn security.csv','scopus','\0'),(2346,'OData for service-oriented business applications: Comparative analysis of communication technologies for flexible Service-Oriented IT architectures','2015','0','DCOM;Java RMI;OData;REST;SOA','This document examines the OData protocol as a new service oriented approach for distributed IT architectures.

The Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style has been extensively used recently for integrating services and applications. Its adoption to build SOA-based distributed systems brings several benefits, but also poses new challenges and risks. Particularly important among those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. A proved efficient technique to identify and help mitigate those risks is the architecture evaluation. In this paper we propose an approach, tooling, and guidelines to aid architecture evaluation activities in REST-based systems. These guidelines can be systematically used along with evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and tradeoffs. To demonstrate how the guidelines can help architecture evaluators, we present a proof of concept describing how to use the guidelines in an ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) evaluation. We also present the results of a survey conducted with industry specialists who have performed architecture evaluations in real world REST-based systems in order to gauge the suitability and utility of the proposed guidelines.

For this paradigm, service oriented Architecture (SOA) is a pillar block to build applications. For service-based applications in the cloud, management becomes a challenging task since it involves an increasing number of layers and a huge number of parameters to take into account. In this paper, we propose a framework that generates self-managed and scalable micro-containers. These micro-containers are enhanced with the resiliency of cellular organisms assuring the fault, configuration, accounting, performance and security constraints (FCAPS) described for each service. The proposed intelligent managed micro-container (IMMC) has a self-monitoring service that allows it to take decisions to enhance its scalability based on migration and replication transactions. These transactions are performed using a Mobility service offered by our IMMC. The primary evaluation that we conducted using our framework are encouraging.','Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE), 2013 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on',1,'M.

We analyze two architectures to implement this method which are Shift-Log-by-WebService and Shift-Log-by-ActiveMQ. Initial experiments show the efficiency of later one.

It can configure services in one of the three following modes: distributed, centralized and hybrid. It also supports automatic reconfiguration in the event of service failures. This system uses a generic cost representation for services that may include spatial coverage of the services in an area of interest along with other service configuration cost metrics.

We describe an efficient implementation of data-flow integrity enforcement that uses static analysis to reduce instrumentation overhead.
